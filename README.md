| **[MCTuner: Spatial Decomposition-Enhanced Database Tuning via LLM-Guided Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06298v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of modern database management systems, which often expose hundreds of knobs with continuous or categorical values. However, the large number of knobs and the vast configuration space make it difficult to identify optimal settings efficiently. Although learning-based tuning has shown promise, existing approaches either ignore domain knowledge by relying solely on benchmark feedback or struggle to explore the high-dimensional knob space, resulting in high tuning costs and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MCTuner, an adaptive knob tuning framework that minimizes exploration in ineffective regions of the configuration space. MCTuner employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with specialized LLMs to identify performance-critical knobs. In further, MCTuner introduces the first spatial decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space into hierarchical subspaces, on which Bayesian Optimization is performed to efficiently search for near-optimal configurations. Evaluated on different benchmarks (OLAP, OLTP, and HTAP), MCTuner achieves up to 19.2% performance gains and 1.4x faster configuration discovery per iteration compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2ETune: End-to-End Knob Tuning via Fine-tuned Generative Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11581v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is a significant challenge for database administrators, as it involves tuning a large number of configuration knobs with continuous or discrete values to achieve optimal database performance. Traditional methods, such as manual tuning or learning-based approaches, typically require numerous workload replays and are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce E2ETune, an end-to-end knob tuner powered by a fine-tuned generative language model. The key idea is to leverage the exceptional sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of generative language models to capture the complex mapping between workloads (inputs) and their corresponding promising configurations (outputs). To achieve this goal, we propose a novel data generation framework to efficiently produce a large amount of training data, where each data sample consists of a workload and its promising configuration. Then, these data are used to fine-tune a generative language model, yielding an end-to-end knob tuner. This tuner offers out-of-the-box configuration recommendations for new workloads. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate E2ETune's efficiency and effectiveness using 10 representative and 3 real-world benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, E2ETune can identify competitive configurations in significantly less time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Is Large Language Model Good at Database Knob Tuning? A Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02213v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance. However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific. Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored. This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask. We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain. Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments. Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner. We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications. Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT: Micro-Invasive Database Configuration Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00616v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of database knob tuning has always been a challenging task. Recently, database knob tuning methods has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, these methods still face certain limitations.On one hand, when applying knob tuning algorithms to optimize databases in practice, it either requires frequent updates to the database or necessitates acquiring database workload and optimizing through workload replay. The former approach involves constant exploration and updating of database configurations, inevitably leading to a decline in database performance during optimization. The latter, on the other hand, requires the acquisition of workload data, which could lead to data leakage issues. Moreover, the hyperparameter configuration space for database knobs is vast, making it challenging for optimizers to converge. These factors significantly hinder the practical implementation of database tuning. To address these concerns, we proposes an efficient and micro-invasive knob tuning method. This method relies on workload synthesis on cloned databases to simulate the workload that needs tuning, thus minimizing the intrusion on the database. And we utilizing a configuration replacement strategy to filter configuration candidates that perform well under the synthesized workload to find best configuration. And during the tuning process, we employ a knowledge transfer method to extract a common high-performance space, to boost the convergence of the optimizer.</p></details> |  |

| **[Budget-aware Query Tuning: An AutoML Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00137v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern database systems rely on cost-based query optimizers to come up with good execution plans for input queries. Such query optimizers rely on cost models to estimate the costs of candidate query execution plans. A cost model represents a function from a set of cost units to query execution cost, where each cost unit specifies the unit cost of executing a certain type of query processing operation (such as table scan or join). These cost units are traditionally viewed as constants, whose values only depend on the platform configuration where the database system runs on top of but are invariant for queries processed by the database system. In this paper, we challenge this classic view by thinking of these cost units as variables instead. We show that, by varying the cost-unit values one can obtain query plans that significantly outperform the default query plans returned by the query optimizer when viewing the cost units as constants. We term this cost-unit tuning process "query tuning" (QT) and show that it is similar to the well-known hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) problem in AutoML. As a result, any state-of-the-art HPO technologies can be applied to QT. We study the QT problem in the context of anytime tuning, which is desirable in practice by constraining the total time spent on QT within a given budget -- we call this problem budget-aware query tuning. We further extend our study from tuning a single query to tuning a workload with multiple queries, and we call this generalized problem budget-aware workload tuning (WT), which aims for minimizing the execution time of the entire workload. WT is more challenging as one needs to further prioritize individual query tuning within the given time budget. We propose solutions to both QT and WT and experimental evaluation using both benchmark and real workloads demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Query Tuning: Towards Effective Usage of Intermediate Representations for Parameter and Memory Efficient Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03220v2)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intermediate features of a pre-trained model have been shown informative for making accurate predictions on downstream tasks, even if the model backbone is kept frozen. The key challenge is how to utilize these intermediate features given their gigantic amount. We propose visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers. Through introducing a handful of learnable ``query'' tokens to each layer, VQT leverages the inner workings of Transformers to ``summarize'' rich intermediate features of each layer, which can then be used to train the prediction heads of downstream tasks. As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learns to combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to many other parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt features and need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests the complementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning. Empirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach that utilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms full fine-tuning in many cases. Compared to parameter-efficient approaches that adapt features, VQT achieves much higher accuracy under memory constraints. Most importantly, VQT is compatible with these approaches to attain even higher accuracy, making it a simple add-on to further boost transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2023.

| **[OptImatch: Semantic Web System with Knowledge Base for Query Performance Problem Determination](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03302v1)** | 2015-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database query performance problem determination is often performed by analyzing query execution plans (QEPs) in addition to other performance data. As the query workloads that organizations run, have become larger and more complex, analyzing QEPs manually even by experts has become a very time consuming. Most performance diagnostic tools help with identifying problematic queries and most query tuning tools address a limited number of known problems and recommendations. We present the OptImatch system that offers a way to (a) look for varied user defined problem patterns in QEPs and (b) automatically get recommendations from an expert provided and user customizable knowledge base. Existing approaches do not provide the ability to perform workload analysis with flexible user defined patterns, as they lack the ability to impose a proper structure on QEPs. We introduce a novel semantic web system that allows a relatively naive user to search for arbitrary patterns and to get recommendations stored in a knowledge base either by experts or added by the user tailored to the environment in which they operate. Our methodology includes transforming a QEP into an RDF graph and transforming a GUI based user-defined pattern into a SPARQL query through handlers. The SPARQL query is matched against the abstracted RDF graph, and any matched portion of the abstracted RDF graph is relayed back to the user. With the knowledge base, the OptImatch system automatically scans and matches interesting stored patterns in a statistical way as appropriate and returns the corresponding recommendations. Although the knowledge base patterns and solution recommendations are not in the context of the user supplied QEPs, the context is adapted automatically through the handler tagging interface.</p></details> | 12 pages |
