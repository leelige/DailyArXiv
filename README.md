| **[MCTuner: Spatial Decomposition-Enhanced Database Tuning via LLM-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06298v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of modern database management systems, which often expose hundreds of knobs with continuous or categorical values. However, the large number of knobs and the vast configuration space make it difficult to identify optimal settings efficiently. Although learning-based tuning has shown promise, existing approaches either ignore domain knowledge by relying solely on benchmark feedback or struggle to explore the high-dimensional knob space, resulting in high tuning costs and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MCTuner, an adaptive knob tuning framework that minimizes exploration in ineffective regions of the configuration space. MCTuner employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with specialized LLMs to identify performance-critical knobs. In further, MCTuner introduces the first spatial decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space into hierarchical subspaces, on which Bayesian Optimization is performed to efficiently search for near-optimal configurations. Evaluated on different benchmarks (OLAP, OLTP, and HTAP), MCTuner achieves up to 19.2% performance gains and 1.4x faster configuration discovery per iteration compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2ETune: End-to-End Knob Tuning via Fine-tuned Generative Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11581v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is a significant challenge for database administrators, as it involves tuning a large number of configuration knobs with continuous or discrete values to achieve optimal database performance. Traditional methods, such as manual tuning or learning-based approaches, typically require numerous workload replays and are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce E2ETune, an end-to-end knob tuner powered by a fine-tuned generative language model. The key idea is to leverage the exceptional sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of generative language models to capture the complex mapping between workloads (inputs) and their corresponding promising configurations (outputs). To achieve this goal, we propose a novel data generation framework to efficiently produce a large amount of training data, where each data sample consists of a workload and its promising configuration. Then, these data are used to fine-tune a generative language model, yielding an end-to-end knob tuner. This tuner offers out-of-the-box configuration recommendations for new workloads. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate E2ETune's efficiency and effectiveness using 10 representative and 3 real-world benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, E2ETune can identify competitive configurations in significantly less time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Is Large Language Model Good at Database Knob Tuning? A Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02213v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance. However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific. Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored. This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask. We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain. Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments. Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner. We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications. Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT: Micro-Invasive Database Configuration Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00616v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of database knob tuning has always been a challenging task. Recently, database knob tuning methods has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, these methods still face certain limitations.On one hand, when applying knob tuning algorithms to optimize databases in practice, it either requires frequent updates to the database or necessitates acquiring database workload and optimizing through workload replay. The former approach involves constant exploration and updating of database configurations, inevitably leading to a decline in database performance during optimization. The latter, on the other hand, requires the acquisition of workload data, which could lead to data leakage issues. Moreover, the hyperparameter configuration space for database knobs is vast, making it challenging for optimizers to converge. These factors significantly hinder the practical implementation of database tuning. To address these concerns, we proposes an efficient and micro-invasive knob tuning method. This method relies on workload synthesis on cloned databases to simulate the workload that needs tuning, thus minimizing the intrusion on the database. And we utilizing a configuration replacement strategy to filter configuration candidates that perform well under the synthesized workload to find best configuration. And during the tuning process, we employ a knowledge transfer method to extract a common high-performance space, to boost the convergence of the optimizer.</p></details> |  |

| **[KScaNN: Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on Kunpeng](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03298v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a cornerstone algorithm for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and machine learning applications. While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this domain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a critical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port of existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial performance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel ANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN embodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware algorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific optimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques, including a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual calculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an ML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of search parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and 3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for the critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results demonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a new standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based solution. This work provides a definitive blueprint for achieving leadership-class performance for vector search on modern ARM architectures and underscores</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget-aware Query Tuning: An AutoML Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00137v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern database systems rely on cost-based query optimizers to come up with good execution plans for input queries. Such query optimizers rely on cost models to estimate the costs of candidate query execution plans. A cost model represents a function from a set of cost units to query execution cost, where each cost unit specifies the unit cost of executing a certain type of query processing operation (such as table scan or join). These cost units are traditionally viewed as constants, whose values only depend on the platform configuration where the database system runs on top of but are invariant for queries processed by the database system. In this paper, we challenge this classic view by thinking of these cost units as variables instead. We show that, by varying the cost-unit values one can obtain query plans that significantly outperform the default query plans returned by the query optimizer when viewing the cost units as constants. We term this cost-unit tuning process "query tuning" (QT) and show that it is similar to the well-known hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) problem in AutoML. As a result, any state-of-the-art HPO technologies can be applied to QT. We study the QT problem in the context of anytime tuning, which is desirable in practice by constraining the total time spent on QT within a given budget -- we call this problem budget-aware query tuning. We further extend our study from tuning a single query to tuning a workload with multiple queries, and we call this generalized problem budget-aware workload tuning (WT), which aims for minimizing the execution time of the entire workload. WT is more challenging as one needs to further prioritize individual query tuning within the given time budget. We propose solutions to both QT and WT and experimental evaluation using both benchmark and real workloads demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Query Tuning: Towards Effective Usage of Intermediate Representations for Parameter and Memory Efficient Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03220v2)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intermediate features of a pre-trained model have been shown informative for making accurate predictions on downstream tasks, even if the model backbone is kept frozen. The key challenge is how to utilize these intermediate features given their gigantic amount. We propose visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers. Through introducing a handful of learnable ``query'' tokens to each layer, VQT leverages the inner workings of Transformers to ``summarize'' rich intermediate features of each layer, which can then be used to train the prediction heads of downstream tasks. As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learns to combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to many other parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt features and need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests the complementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning. Empirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach that utilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms full fine-tuning in many cases. Compared to parameter-efficient approaches that adapt features, VQT achieves much higher accuracy under memory constraints. Most importantly, VQT is compatible with these approaches to attain even higher accuracy, making it a simple add-on to further boost transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2023.

| **[OptImatch: Semantic Web System with Knowledge Base for Query Performance Problem Determination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03302v1)** | 2015-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database query performance problem determination is often performed by analyzing query execution plans (QEPs) in addition to other performance data. As the query workloads that organizations run, have become larger and more complex, analyzing QEPs manually even by experts has become a very time consuming. Most performance diagnostic tools help with identifying problematic queries and most query tuning tools address a limited number of known problems and recommendations. We present the OptImatch system that offers a way to (a) look for varied user defined problem patterns in QEPs and (b) automatically get recommendations from an expert provided and user customizable knowledge base. Existing approaches do not provide the ability to perform workload analysis with flexible user defined patterns, as they lack the ability to impose a proper structure on QEPs. We introduce a novel semantic web system that allows a relatively naive user to search for arbitrary patterns and to get recommendations stored in a knowledge base either by experts or added by the user tailored to the environment in which they operate. Our methodology includes transforming a QEP into an RDF graph and transforming a GUI based user-defined pattern into a SPARQL query through handlers. The SPARQL query is matched against the abstracted RDF graph, and any matched portion of the abstracted RDF graph is relayed back to the user. With the knowledge base, the OptImatch system automatically scans and matches interesting stored patterns in a statistical way as appropriate and returns the corresponding recommendations. Although the knowledge base patterns and solution recommendations are not in the context of the user supplied QEPs, the context is adapted automatically through the handler tagging interface.</p></details> | 12 pages |

| **[Metronome: Differentiated Delay Scheduling for Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Inference with Mondrian Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09702v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests are popular methods for regression and classification analysis, and many different variants have been proposed in recent years. One interesting example is the Mondrian random forest, in which the underlying constituent trees are constructed via a Mondrian process. We give precise bias and variance characterizations, along with a Berry-Esseen-type central limit theorem, for the Mondrian random forest regression estimator. By combining these results with a carefully crafted debiasing approach and an accurate variance estimator, we present valid statistical inference methods for the unknown regression function. These methods come with explicitly characterized error bounds in terms of the sample size, tree complexity parameter, and number of trees in the forest, and include coverage error rates for feasible confidence interval estimators. Our debiasing procedure for the Mondrian random forest also allows it to achieve the minimax-optimal point estimation convergence rate in mean squared error for multivariate $β$-Hölder regression functions, for all $β> 0$, provided that the underlying tuning parameters are chosen appropriately. Efficient and implementable algorithms are devised for both batch and online learning settings, and we study the computational complexity of different Mondrian random forest implementations. Finally, simulations with synthetic data validate our theory and methodology, demonstrating their excellent finite-sample properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |

Utilizing a dataset comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model, achieving high predictive performance as evidenced by R2 scores and Mean Squared Errors (MSE). The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in providing accurate predictions, which is validated through various performance metrics including residual plots and learning curves. The findings underscore the potential of ensemble learning techniques in enhancing material property predictions, with implications for industrial applications in material science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the spatial distribution and demographics of commercial swine farms in the United States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00132v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data on livestock farm locations and demographics are essential for disease monitoring, risk assessment, and developing spatially explicit epidemiological models. Our semantic segmentation model achieved an F2 score of 92 % and a mean Intersection over Union of 76 %. An initial total of 194,474 swine barn candidates were identified in the Southeast (North Carolina = 111,135, South Carolina = 37,264 Virginia = 46,075) and 524,962 in the Midwest (Iowa = 168,866 Minnesota = 165,714 Ohio = 190,382). The post processing Random Forest classifier reduced false positives by 82 % in the Southeast and 88 % in the Midwest, resulting in 45,580 confirmed barn polygons. These were grouped into 16,976 predicted farms and classified into one of the four production types. Population sizes were then estimated using the Random Forest regression model, with prediction accuracy varying by production type. Across all farms, 87 % of predictions for operations with 1,000 2,000 pigs were within 500 pigs of the reference value, with nursery farms showing the highest agreement (R2= 0.82), followed by finisher farms (R2 = 0.77) and sow farms (R2 = 0.56). Our results revealed substantial gaps in the existing spatial and demographic data on U.S. swine production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Machine Learning for Urban Heat Mitigation: Attribution and Weighting of Multi-Scale Drivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04802v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features, respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency, a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator for Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled to the Noah land surface model (LSM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature (T2). Using random forest regression (RFR) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained on WRF output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in 2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers - most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in training. With RFR-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce uncertainties and test the method on other cities, the proposed approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI mitigation assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence for Cost-Aware Resource Prediction in Big Data Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05127v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient resource allocation is a key challenge in modern cloud computing. Over-provisioning leads to unnecessary costs, while under-provisioning risks performance degradation and SLA violations. This work presents an artificial intelligence approach to predict resource utilization in big data pipelines using Random Forest regression. We preprocess the Google Borg cluster traces to clean, transform, and extract relevant features (CPU, memory, usage distributions). The model achieves high predictive accuracy (R Square = 0.99, MAE = 0.0048, RMSE = 0.137), capturing non-linear relationships between workload characteristics and resource utilization. Error analysis reveals impressive performance on small-to-medium jobs, with higher variance in rare large-scale jobs. These results demonstrate the potential of AI-driven prediction for cost-aware autoscaling in cloud environments, reducing unnecessary provisioning while safeguarding service quality.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Short-Term Regional Electricity Demand Forecasting in Argentina Using LSTM Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19374v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly electricity demand in Córdoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of 0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii) an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.</p></details> | 44 pages, 13 figures |
| **[IoT-based Noise Monitoring using Mobile Nodes for Smart Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00979v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Corrosion Resistance of Aluminum Alloys Through AI and ML Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11685v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript length: 11 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Lightweight Face Quality Assessment Framework to Improve Face Verification Performance in Real-Time Screening Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15961v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control. Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an accuracy of 96.67%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance, including a comfortable 99.7% reduction in the false rejection rate and enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening: variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent in practical surveillance scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Random Forests by Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06852v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases, also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact tree-splitting locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 4 pages appendix, 3 figures in appendix</p></details> |

This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9Page...</summary><p>9Pages, 3 Figures and 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Chemicals Through Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14708v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Civilizations have tried to make drinking water safe to consume for thousands of years. The process of determining water contaminants has evolved with the complexity of the contaminants due to pesticides and heavy metals. The routine procedure to determine water safety is to use targeted analysis which searches for specific substances from some known list; however, we do not explicitly know which substances should be on this list. Before experimentally determining which substances are contaminants, how do we answer the sampling problem of identifying all the substances in the water? Here, we present an approach that builds on the work of Jaanus Liigand et al., which used non-targeted analysis that conducts a broader search on the sample to develop a random-forest regression model, to predict the names of all the substances in a sample, as well as their respective concentrations[1]. This work utilizes techniques from dimensionality reduction and linear decompositions to present a more accurate model using data from the European Massbank Metabolome Library to produce a global list of chemicals that researchers can then identify and test for when purifying water.</p></details> | 12 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Estimated Roadway Segment Traffic Data by Vehicle Class for the United States: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05161v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Highway Performance Monitoring System, managed by the Federal Highway Administration, provides essential data on average annual daily traffic across U.S. roadways, but it has limited representation of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles on non-interstate roads. This gap limits research and policy analysis on the impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including references, 5 figures</p></details> |

Airborne hyperspectral imaging has shown promise for measuring plant diversity remotely, but to operationalise these efforts over large regions we need to advance satellite-based alternatives. The advanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique opportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground estimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to assess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for species richness prediction. The best prediction results were $r=0.76$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.89$ for the Southern Tablelands region, and $r=0.68$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.95$ for the Snowy Mountains region. Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral bands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more important for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the near-infrared bands beyond red-edge. We also found that the DESIS hyperspectral data performed better than Sentinel-2 multispectral data in the prediction of plant species richness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

In this we have used low-cost Non-Dispersive Infrared CO$_2$ sensor placed at a co-located site at Cape Point, South Africa (maintained by Weather South Africa). The collected low-cost sensor data and site truth data are investigated and compared. We compare and investigate the performance of Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, 1D Convolutional Neural Network and 1D-CNN Long Short-Term Memory Network models as a method for automatic calibration and the statistical properties of these model predictions.

We show the performance of these methods and found that Random Forest Regression was the best in this scenario. This shows that these machine learning methods can be used to improve the performance of cost-effective sensor platforms and possibly extend the time between manual calibration of sensor networks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an AI-driven approach to optimizing FPGA overlay configurations, specifically focusing on the NAPOLY+ automata processor implemented on the ZCU104 FPGA. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest regression, we predict the feasibility and efficiency of different configurations before hardware compilation. Our method significantly reduces the number of required iterations by estimating resource utilization, including logical elements, distributed memory, and fanout, based on historical design data. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high prediction accuracy, closely matching actual resource usage while accelerating the design process.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Machine Learning Approach for Design of Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Material via Image Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17534v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper presents an innovative methodology for designing frequency selective surface (FSS) based radar absorbing materials using machine learning (ML) technique. In conventional electromagnetic design, unit cell dimensions of FSS are used as input and absorption coefficient is then predicted for a given design. In this paper, absorption coefficient is considered as input to ML model and image of FSS unit cell is predicted. Later, this image is used for generating the FSS unit cell parameters. Eleven different ML models are studied over a wide frequency band of 1GHz to 30GHz. Out of which six ML models (i.e. (a) Random Forest classification, (b) K- Neighbors Classification, (c) Grid search regression, (d) Random Forest regression, (e) Decision tree classification, and (f) Decision tree regression) show training accuracy more than 90%. The absorption coefficients with varying frequencies of these predicted images are subsequently evaluated using commercial electromagnetic solver. The performance of these ML models is encouraging, and it can be used for accelerating design and optimization of high performance FSS based radar absorbing material for advanced electromagnetic applications in future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Performance of Object Detection Models in Electron Microscopy Using Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08465v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying prediction uncertainty when applying object detection models to new, unlabeled datasets is critical in applied machine learning. This study introduces an approach to estimate the performance of deep learning-based object detection models for quantifying defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, focusing on detecting irradiation-induced cavities in TEM images of metal alloys. We developed a random forest regression model that predicts the object detection F1 score, a statistical metric used to evaluate the ability to accurately locate and classify objects of interest. The random forest model uses features extracted from the predictions of the object detection model whose uncertainty is being quantified, enabling fast prediction on new, unlabeled images. The mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting F1 of the trained model on test data is 0.09, and the $R^2$ score is 0.77, indicating there is a significant correlation between the random forest regression model predicted and true defect detection F1 scores. The approach is shown to be robust across three distinct TEM image datasets with varying imaging and material domains. Our approach enables users to estimate the reliability of a defect detection and segmentation model predictions and assess the applicability of the model to their specific datasets, providing valuable information about possible domain shifts and whether the model needs to be fine-tuned or trained on additional data to be maximally effective for the desired use case.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reliable Vertical Ground Reaction Force Estimation with Smart Insole During Walking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07748v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and its characteristic weight acceptance and push-off peaks measured during walking are important for gait and biomechanical analysis. Current wearable vGRF estimation methods suffer from drifting errors or low generalization performances, limiting their practical application. This paper proposes a novel method for reliably estimating vGRF and its characteristic peaks using data collected from the smart insole, including inertial measurement unit data and the newly introduced center of the pressed sensor data. These data were fused with machine learning algorithms including artificial neural networks, random forest regression, and bi-directional long-short-term memory. The proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with the root mean squared error, normalized root mean squared error, and correlation coefficient of 0.024 body weight (BW), 1.79% BW, and 0.997 in intra-participant testing, and 0.044 BW, 3.22% BW, and 0.991 in inter-participant testing, respectively. The difference between the reference and estimated weight acceptance and push-off peak values are 0.022 BW and 0.017 BW with a delay of 1.4% and 1.8% of the gait cycle for the intra-participant testing and 0.044 BW and 0.025 BW with a delay of 1.5% and 2.3% of the gait cycle for the inter-participant testing. The results indicate that the proposed vGRF estimation method has the potential to achieve accurate vGRF measurement during walking in free living environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction-Assisted Online Distributed Deep Learning Workload Scheduling in GPU Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05563v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent explosive growth of deep learning (DL) models has necessitated a compelling need for efficient job scheduling for distributed deep learning training with mixed parallelisms (DDLwMP) in GPU clusters. This paper proposes an adaptive shortest-remaining-processing-time-first (A-SRPT) scheduling algorithm, a novel prediction-assisted online scheduling approach designed to mitigate the challenges associated with DL cluster scheduling. By modeling each job as a graph corresponding to heterogeneous Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and their associated distributed training configurations, A-SRPT strategically assigns jobs to the available GPUs, thereby minimizing inter-server communication overhead. Observing that most DDLwMP jobs recur, A-SRPT incorporates a random forest regression model to predict training iterations. Crucially, A-SRPT maps the complex scheduling problem into a single-machine instance, which is addressed optimally by a preemptive "shortest-remaining-processing-time-first" strategy. This optimized solution serves as a guide for actual job scheduling within the GPU clusters, leading to a theoretically provable competitive scheduling efficiency. We conduct extensive real-world testbed and simulation experiments to verify our proposed algorithms.</p></details> | INFOCOM 2025 |
| **[Random Forest Regression Feature Importance for Climate Impact Pathway Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16609v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disturbances to the climate system, both natural and anthropogenic, have far reaching impacts that are not always easy to identify or quantify using traditional climate science analyses or causal modeling techniques. In this paper, we develop a novel technique for discovering and ranking the chain of spatio-temporal downstream impacts of a climate source, referred to herein as a source-impact pathway, using Random Forest Regression (RFR) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) feature importances. Rather than utilizing RFR for classification or regression tasks (the most common use case for RFR), we propose a fundamentally new workflow in which we: (i) train random forest (RF) regressors on a set of spatio-temporal features of interest, (ii) calculate their pair-wise feature importances using the SHAP weights associated with those features, and (iii) translate these feature importances into a weighted pathway network (i.e., a weighted directed graph), which can be used to trace out and rank interdependencies between climate features and/or modalities. Importantly, while herein we employ RFR and SHAP feature importance in steps (i) and (ii) of our algorithm, our novel workflow is in no way tied to these approaches, which could be replaced with any regression method and sensitivity method. We adopt a tiered verification approach to verify our new pathway identification methodology. In this approach, we apply our method to ensembles of data generated by running two increasingly complex benchmarks: (i) a set of synthetic coupled equations, and (ii) a fully coupled simulation of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines performed using a modified version 2 of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv2). We find that our RFR feature importance-based approach can accurately detect known pathways of impact for both test cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Silico Pharmacokinetic and Molecular Docking Studies of Natural Plants against Essential Protein KRAS for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06237v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A kind of pancreatic cancer called Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is anticipated to be one of the main causes of mortality during past years. Evidence from several researches supported the concept that the oncogenic KRAS (Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene) mutation is the major cause of pancreatic cancer. KRAS acts as an on-off switch that promotes cell growth. But when the KRAS gene is mutated, it will be in one position, allowing the cell growth uncontrollably. This uncontrollable multiplication of cells causes cancer growth. Therefore, KRAS was selected as the target protein in the study. Fifty plant-derived compounds are selected for the study. To determine whether the examined drugs could bind to the KRAS complex's binding pocket, molecular docking was performed. Computational analyses were used to assess the possible ability of tested substances to pass the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). To predict the bioactivity of ligands a machine learning model was created. Five machine learning models were created and have chosen the best one among them for analyzing the bioactivity of each ligand. From the fifty plant-derived compounds the compounds with the least binding energies are selected. Then bioactivity of these six compounds is analyzed using Random Forest Regression model. Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) properties of compounds are analyzed. The results showed that borneol has powerful effects and acts as a promising agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This suggests that borneol found in plants like mint, ginger, rosemary, etc., is a successful compound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer vs. Decision Mamba: Analysing the Complexity of Sequential Decision Making in Atari Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00725v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work analyses the disparity in performance between Decision Transformer (DT) and Decision Mamba (DM) in sequence modelling reinforcement learning tasks for different Atari games. The study first observed that DM generally outperformed DT in the games Breakout and Qbert, while DT performed better in more complicated games, such as Hero and Kung Fu Master. To understand these differences, we expanded the number of games to 12 and performed a comprehensive analysis of game characteristics, including action space complexity, visual complexity, average trajectory length, and average steps to the first non-zero reward. In order to further analyse the key factors that impact the disparity in performance between DT and DM, we employ various approaches, including quantifying visual complexity, random forest regression, correlation analysis, and action space simplification strategies. The results indicate that the performance gap between DT and DM is affected by the complex interaction of multiple factors, with the complexity of the action space and visual complexity (particularly evaluated by compression ratio) being the primary determining factors. DM performs well in environments with simple action and visual elements, while DT shows an advantage in games with higher action and visual complexity. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the game characteristics affect the performance difference in sequential modelling reinforcement learning, potentially guiding the development of future model design and applications for diverse and complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics. The Bi-LSTM model effectively predicts contaminant concentrations for the next four years, demonstrating the potential of advanced time series analysis to improve MNA strategies and reduce reliance on manual groundwater sampling.

However, right-sizing the function memory force developers to speculate performance and make ad-hoc configuration decisions. Recent research has highlighted that a function's input characteristics, such as input size, type and number of inputs, significantly impact its resource demand, run-time performance and costs with fluctuating workloads. This correlation further makes memory configuration a non-trivial task. On that account, an input-aware function memory allocator not only improves developer productivity by completely hiding resource-related decisions but also drives an opportunity to reduce resource wastage and offer a finer-grained cost-optimised pricing scheme. Therefore, we present MemFigLess, a serverless solution that estimates the memory requirement of a serverless function with input-awareness. The framework executes function profiling in an offline stage and trains a multi-output Random Forest Regression model on the collected metrics to invoke input-aware optimal configurations. We evaluate our work with the state-of-the-art approaches on AWS Lambda service to find that MemFigLess is able to capture the input-aware resource relationships and allocate upto 82% less resources and save up to 87% run-time costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 tables, 28 figures, accepted conference paper - UCC'24</p></details> |

As this process is believed to be gradual and telecommuting is likely to remain an option for many workers, hybrid model and flexible schedules might become the norm in the future. This variable work schedules allows employees to commute outside of traditional rush hours. Moreover, many studies showed that commuters might be skeptical of using trains, buses, and carpools and could turn to personal vehicles to get to work, which might increase congestion and crashes in the roads. This study attempts to provide information on the safest time to commute to Washington, DC area analyzing historical traffic crash data before the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aims to advance our understanding of traffic crashes and other relating factors such as weather in the Washington, DC area. We created a model to predict crashes by time of the day, using a negative binomial regression after rejecting a Poisson regression, and additionally explored the validity of a Random Forest regression. Our main consideration for an eventual application of this study is to reduce crashes in Washington DC, using this tool that provides people with better options on when to commute and when to telework, if available. The study also provides policymakers and researchers with real-world insights that decrease the number of traffic crashes to help achieve the goals of The Vision Zero Initiative adopted by the district.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling the restricted mean survival time using pseudo-value random forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01381v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The restricted mean survival time (RMST) has become a popular measure to summarize event times in longitudinal studies. Defined as the area under the survival function up to a time horizon $τ$ > 0, the RMST can be interpreted as the life expectancy within the time interval [0, $τ$]. In addition to its straightforward interpretation, the RMST also allows for the definition of valid estimands for the causal analysis of treatment contrasts in medical studies. In this work, we introduce a non-parametric approach to model the RMST conditional on a set of baseline variables (including, e.g., treatment variables and confounders). Our method is based on a direct modeling strategy for the RMST, using leave-one-out jackknife pseudo-values within a random forest regression framework. In this way, it can be employed to obtain precise estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and confounder-adjusted treatment contrasts. Since our method (termed "pseudo-value random forest", PVRF) is model-free, RMST estimates are not affected by restrictive assumptions like the proportional hazards assumption. Particularly, PVRF offers a high flexibility in detecting relevant covariate effects from higher-dimensional data, thereby expanding the range of existing pseudo-value modeling techniques for RMST estimation. We investigate the properties of our method using simulations and illustrate its use by an application to data from the SUCCESS-A breast cancer trial. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that PVRF yields accurate estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and RMST-based treatment contrasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Prediction Models for Changes in Knee Pain among Patients with Osteoarthritis Participating in Supervised Exercise and Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12597v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread chronic condition that impairs mobility and diminishes quality of life. Despite the proven benefits of exercise therapy and patient education in managing the OA symptoms pain and functional limitations, these strategies are often underutilized. Personalized outcome prediction models can help motivate and engage patients, but the accuracy of existing models in predicting changes in knee pain remains insufficiently examined. To validate existing models and introduce a concise personalized model predicting changes in knee pain before to after participating in a supervised education and exercise therapy program (GLA:D) for knee OA patients. Our models use self-reported patient information and functional measures. To refine the number of variables, we evaluated the variable importance and applied clinical reasoning. We trained random forest regression models and compared the rate of true predictions of our models with those utilizing average values. We evaluated the performance of a full, continuous, and concise model including all 34, all 11 continuous, and the six most predictive variables respectively. All three models performed similarly and were comparable to the existing model, with R-squares of 0.31-0.32 and RMSEs of 18.65-18.85 - despite our increased sample size. Allowing a deviation of 15 VAS points from the true change in pain, our concise model and utilizing the average values estimated the change in pain at 58% and 51% correctly, respectively. Our supplementary analysis led to similar outcomes. Our concise personalized prediction model more accurately predicts changes in knee pain following the GLA:D program compared to average pain improvement values. Neither the increase in sample size nor the inclusion of additional variables improved previous models. To improve predictions, new variables beyond those in the GLA:D are required.</p></details> |  |

| **[Privacy-preserving federated prediction of pain intensity change based on multi-center survey data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07997v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Patient-reported survey data are used to train prognostic models aimed at improving healthcare. However, such data are typically available multi-centric and, for privacy reasons, cannot easily be centralized in one data repository. Models trained locally are less accurate, robust, and generalizable. We present and apply privacy-preserving federated machine learning techniques for prognostic model building, where local survey data never leaves the legally safe harbors of the medical centers. Methods: We used centralized, local, and federated learning techniques on two healthcare datasets (GLA:D data from the five health regions of Denmark and international SHARE data of 27 countries) to predict two different health outcomes. We compared linear regression, random forest regression, and random forest classification models trained on local data with those trained on the entire data in a centralized and in a federated fashion. Results: In GLA:D data, federated linear regression (R2 0.34, RMSE 18.2) and federated random forest regression (R2 0.34, RMSE 18.3) models outperform their local counterparts (i.e., R2 0.32, RMSE 18.6, R2 0.30, RMSE 18.8) with statistical significance. We also found that centralized models (R2 0.34, RMSE 18.2, R2 0.32, RMSE 18.5, respectively) did not perform significantly better than the federated models. In SHARE, the federated model (AC 0.78, AUROC: 0.71) and centralized model (AC 0.84, AUROC: 0.66) perform significantly better than the local models (AC: 0.74, AUROC: 0.69). Conclusion: Federated learning enables the training of prognostic models from multi-center surveys without compromising privacy and with only minimal or no compromise regarding model performance.</p></details> |  |

The intervals are built around a class of nonparametric regression algorithms based on subsampled kernels. This class encompasses various forms of subsampled random forest regression, including Generalized Random Forests (Athey et al., 2019). Although simultaneous validity is often desirable in practice -- for example, for fine-grained characterization of treatment effect heterogeneity -- only confidence intervals that confer pointwise guarantees were previously available. Our work closes this gap. As a by-product, we obtain several new order-explicit results on the concentration and normal approximation of high-dimensional U-statistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Short Term Energy Demand in Smart Grid: A Deep Learning Approach for Integrating Renewable Energy Sources in Line with SDGs 7, 9, and 13](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03997v4)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid is becoming increasingly important as the world moves towards a more sustainable energy future in line with SDG 7. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources can make it challenging to manage the power grid and ensure a stable supply of electricity, which is crucial for achieving SDG 9. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for predicting energy demand in a smart power grid, which can improve the integration of renewable energy sources by providing accurate predictions of energy demand. Our approach aligns with SDG 13 on climate action, enabling more efficient management of renewable energy resources. We use long short-term memory networks, well-suited for time series data, to capture complex patterns and dependencies in energy demand data. The proposed approach is evaluated using four historical short-term energy demand data datasets from different energy distribution companies, including American Electric Power, Commonwealth Edison, Dayton Power and Light, and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection. The proposed model is compared with three other state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms: Facebook Prophet, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The experimental results show that the proposed REDf model can accurately predict energy demand with a mean absolute error of 1.4%, indicating its potential to enhance the stability and efficiency of the power grid and contribute to achieving SDGs 7, 9, and 13. The proposed model also has the potential to manage the integration of renewable energy sources effectively.</p></details> |  |

Despite considerable errors in the baseline models, the study aims to identify influential features in delay prediction, potentially informing flight planning strategies. Unlike previous work, this research focuses on regression tasks and explores the use of time-series models for predicting flight delays. It offers insights into aviation operations by independently analyzing each delay component (e.g., security, weather).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

An integrated strategy is proposed, leveraging the strengths of convolutional and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. This approach is aimed at effectively extracting temporal data from energy datasets to improve the precision of microgrid behavior forecasts. Additionally, an attention layer is employed to underscore significant features within the time-series data, optimizing the forecasting process. The framework is anchored by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is tasked with comprehensive load forecasting and the identification of abnormal grid behaviors. Our methodology underwent rigorous evaluation using the Micro-grid Tariff Assessment Tool dataset, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2-score) serving as the primary metrics. The approach demonstrated exemplary performance, evidenced by a MAE of 0.39, RMSE of 0.28, and an r2-score of 98.89\% in load forecasting, along with near-perfect zero state prediction accuracy (approximately 99.9\%). Significantly outperforming conventional machine learning models such as support vector regression and random forest regression, our model's streamlined architecture is particularly suitable for real-time applications, thereby facilitating more effective and reliable microgrid management.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 11th International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering (ICITACEE)</p></details> |
| **[Comparing remote sensing-based forest biomass mapping approaches using new forest inventory plots in contrasting forests in northeastern and southwestern China](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15438v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale high spatial resolution aboveground biomass (AGB) maps play a crucial role in determining forest carbon stocks and how they are changing, which is instrumental in understanding the global carbon cycle, and implementing policy to mitigate climate change. The advent of the new space-borne LiDAR sensor, NASA's GEDI instrument, provides unparalleled possibilities for the accurate and unbiased estimation of forest AGB at high resolution, particularly in dense and tall forests, where Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and passive optical data exhibit saturation. However, GEDI is a sampling instrument, collecting dispersed footprints, and its data must be combined with that from other continuous cover satellites to create high-resolution maps, using local machine learning methods. In this study, we developed local models to estimate forest AGB from GEDI L2A data, as the models used to create GEDI L4 AGB data incorporated minimal field data from China. We then applied LightGBM and random forest regression to generate wall-to-wall AGB maps at 25 m resolution, using extensive GEDI footprints as well as Sentinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 optical data. Through a 5-fold cross-validation, LightGBM demonstrated a slightly better performance than Random Forest across two contrasting regions. However, in both regions, the computation speed of LightGBM is substantially faster than that of the random forest model, requiring roughly one-third of the time to compute on the same hardware. Through the validation against field data, the 25 m resolution AGB maps generated using the local models developed in this study exhibited higher accuracy compared to the GEDI L4B AGB data. We found in both regions an increase in error as slope increased. The trained models were tested on nearby but different regions and exhibited good performance.</p></details> |  |

In our research, we conducted a thorough assessment of various machine learning algorithms for both classification and regression tasks relevant to predicting wildfires. We found that for classifying different types or stages of wildfires, the XGBoost model outperformed others in terms of accuracy and robustness. Meanwhile, the Random Forest regression model showed superior results in predicting the extent of wildfire-affected areas, excelling in both prediction error and explained variance. Additionally, we developed a hybrid neural network model that integrates numerical data and image information for simultaneous classification and regression. To gain deeper insights into the decision-making processes of these models and identify key contributing features, we utilized eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, including TreeSHAP, LIME, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). These interpretability tools shed light on the significance and interplay of various features, highlighting the complex factors influencing wildfire predictions. Our study not only demonstrates the effectiveness of specific machine learning models in wildfire-related tasks but also underscores the critical role of model transparency and interpretability in environmental science applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2307.09615 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Stochastic Decision-Making of PV Power in Electricity Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20149v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the use of conformal prediction (CP), an emerging probabilistic forecasting method, for day-ahead photovoltaic power predictions to enhance participation in electricity markets. First, machine learning models are used to construct point predictions. Thereafter, several variants of CP are implemented to quantify the uncertainty of those predictions by creating CP intervals and cumulative distribution functions. Optimal quantity bids for the electricity market are estimated using several bidding strategies under uncertainty, namely: trust-the-forecast, worst-case, Newsvendor and expected utility maximization (EUM). Results show that CP in combination with k-nearest neighbors and/or Mondrian binning outperforms its corresponding linear quantile regressors. Using CP in combination with certain bidding strategies can yield high profit with minimal energy imbalance. In concrete, using conformal predictive systems with k-nearest neighbors and Mondrian binning after random forest regression yields the best profit and imbalance regardless of the decision-making strategy. Combining this uncertainty quantification method with the EUM strategy with conditional value at risk (CVaR) can yield up to 93\% of the potential profit with minimal energy imbalance.</p></details> |  |

Thus, this study implements 6 regression models (Linear, Tree, Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, K Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) to predict crop yields in 37 developing countries over 27 years. Given 4 key training parameters, insecticides (tonnes), rainfall (mm), temperature (Celsius), and yield (hg/ha), it was found that our Random Forest Regression model achieved a determination coefficient (r2) of 0.94, with a margin of error (ME) of .03. The models were trained and tested using the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations data, along with the World Bank Climate Change Data Catalog. Furthermore, each parameter was analyzed to understand how varying factors could impact overall yield. We used unconventional models, contrary to generally used Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) models, combined with recently collected data to implement a unique approach in our research.

| **[MITS: A Quantum Sorcerer Stone For Designing Surface Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11027v2)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of quantum computing, determining the most efficient parameters for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is paramount. Various quantum computers possess varied types and amounts of physical noise. Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate. However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming. Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code distances. This guarantees minimal qubit and gate usage, harmonizing the desired logical error rate with the existing hardware limitations on qubit numbers and gate fidelity. We explored and compared multiple heuristics and machine learning models for training/designing MITS and concluded that XGBoost and Random Forest regression were most effective, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96 respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improved Indoor Localization with Machine Learning Techniques for IoT applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11433v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile internet applications has spurred interest in location-based services (LBS) for commercial, military, and social applications. While the global positioning system (GPS) dominates outdoor localization, its efficacy wanes indoors due to signal challenges. Indoor localization systems leverage wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, UWB, selecting based on context. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) technology, known for its accuracy and simplicity, is widely adopted. This study employs machine learning algorithms in three phases: supervised regressors, supervised classifiers, and ensemble methods for RSSI-based indoor localization. Additionally, it introduces a weighted least squares technique and pseudo-linear solution approach to address non-linear RSSI measurement equations by approximating them with linear equations. An experimental testbed, utilizing diverse wireless technologies and anchor nodes, is designed for data collection, employing IoT cloud architectures. Pre-processing involves investigating filters for data refinement before algorithm training. The study employs machine learning models like linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, and decision tree regressor across various wireless technologies. These models estimate the geographical coordinates of a moving target node, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, root mean square errors, precision, recall, sensitivity, coefficient of determinant, and the f1-score. The experiment's outcomes provide insights into the effectiveness of different supervised machine learning techniques in terms of localization accuracy and robustness in indoor environments.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Early Prediction of Geomagnetic Storms by Machine Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10290v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geomagnetic storms (GS) occur when solar winds disrupt Earth's magnetosphere. GS can cause severe damages to satellites, power grids, and communication infrastructures. Estimate of direct economic impacts of a large scale GS exceeds $40 billion a day in the US. Early prediction is critical in preventing and minimizing the hazards. However, current methods either predict several hours ahead but fail to identify all types of GS, or make predictions within short time, e.g., one hour ahead of the occurrence. This work aims to predict all types of geomagnetic storms reliably and as early as possible using big data and machine learning algorithms. By fusing big data collected from multiple ground stations in the world on different aspects of solar measurements and using Random Forests regression with feature selection and downsampling on minor geomagnetic storm instances (which carry majority of the data), we are able to achieve an accuracy of 82.55% on data collected in 2021 when making early predictions three hours in advance. Given that important predictive features such as historic Kp indices are measured every 3 hours and their importance decay quickly with the amount of time in advance, an early prediction of 3 hours ahead of time is believed to be close to the practical limit.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[The Conditioning Bias in Binary Decision Trees and Random Forests and Its Elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10708v1)** | 2023-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision tree and random forest classification and regression are some of the most widely used in machine learning approaches. Binary decision tree implementations commonly use conditioning in the form 'feature $\leq$ (or $<$) threshold', with the threshold being the midpoint between two observed feature values. In this paper, we investigate the bias introduced by the choice of conditioning operator (an intrinsic property of implementations) in the presence of features with lattice characteristics. We propose techniques to eliminate this bias, requiring an additional prediction with decision trees and incurring no cost for random forests. Using 20 classification and 20 regression datasets, we demonstrate that the bias can lead to statistically significant differences in terms of AUC and $r^2$ scores. The proposed techniques successfully mitigate the bias, compared to the worst-case scenario, statistically significant improvements of up to 0.1-0.2 percentage points of AUC and $r^2$ scores were achieved and the improvement of 1.5 percentage points of $r^2$ score was measured in the most sensitive case of random forest regression. The implementation of the study is available on GitHub at the following repository: \url{https://github.com/gykovacs/conditioning_bias}.</p></details> |  |

Non-invasive and cuff-less BP estimation algorithm has gained much attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated that brain bio-impedance (BIOZ) is a promising technique for non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Clinically, treatment for patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) requires monitoring the ICP and BP of patients simultaneously. Estimating BP by brain BIOZ directly can reduce the number of sensors attached to the patients, thus improving their comfort. To address the issues, in this study, we explore the feasibility of leveraging brain BIOZ for BP estimation and propose a novel cuff-less BP estimation approach called BrainZ-BP. Two electrodes are placed on the forehead and occipital bone of the head in the anterior-posterior direction for brain BIOZ measurement. Various features including pulse transit time and morphological features of brain BIOZ are extracted and fed into four regression models for BP estimation. Results show that the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient of random forest regression model are 2.17 mmHg, 3.91 mmHg, and 0.90 for systolic pressure estimation, and are 1.71 mmHg, 3.02 mmHg, and 0.89 for diastolic pressure estimation. The presented BrainZ-BP can be applied in the brain BIOZ-based ICP monitoring scenario to monitor BP simultaneously.</p></details> |  |

This research paper explores the impact of various factors on university students' readiness for change and transition, with a focus on their preparedness for careers. The methodology employed in this study involves designing a survey based on Paul J. Mayer's "The Balance Wheel" to capture students' sentiments on various life aspects, including satisfaction with the educational process and expectations of salary. The collected data from a KBTU student survey (n=47) were processed through machine learning models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression. Subsequently, an intelligent system was built using these models and fuzzy sets. The system is capable of evaluating graduates' readiness for their future careers and demonstrates a high predictive power. The findings of this research have practical implications for educational institutions. Such an intelligent system can serve as a valuable tool for universities to assess and enhance students' preparedness for post-graduation challenges. By recognizing the factors contributing to students' readiness for change, universities can refine curricula and processes to better prepare students for their career journeys.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

| **[Modeling Player Personality Factors from In-Game Behavior and Affective Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14224v1)** | 2023-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a thorough understanding of the target audience (and/or single individuals) is a key factor for success - which is exceptionally important and powerful for the domain of video games that can not only benefit from informed decision making during development, but ideally even tailor game content, difficulty and player experience while playing. The granular assessment of individual personality and differences across players is a particularly difficult endeavor, given the highly variant human nature, disagreement in psychological background models and because of the effortful data collection that most often builds upon long, time-consuming and deterrent questionnaires. In this work, we explore possibilities to predict a series of player personality questionnaire metrics from recorded in-game behavior and extend related work by explicitly adding affective dialog decisions to the game environment which could elevate the model's accuracy. Using random forest regression, we predicted a wide variety of personality metrics from seven established questionnaires across 62 players over 60 minute gameplay of a customized version of the role-playing game Fallout: New Vegas. While some personality variables could already be identified from reasonable underlying in-game actions and affective expressions, we did not find ways to predict others or encountered questionable correlations that could not be justified by theoretical background literature. Yet, building on the initial opportunities of this explorative study, we are striving to massively enlarge our data set to players from an ecologically valid industrial game environment and investigate the performance of more sophisticated machine learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[BREATHE: Second-Order Gradients and Heteroscedastic Emulation based Design Space Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08666v1)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers constantly strive to explore larger and more complex search spaces in various scientific studies and physical experiments. However, such investigations often involve sophisticated simulators or time-consuming experiments that make exploring and observing new design samples challenging. Previous works that target such applications are typically sample-inefficient and restricted to vector search spaces. To address these limitations, this work proposes a constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework, called BREATHE, that searches not only traditional vector-based design spaces but also graph-based design spaces to obtain best-performing graphs. It leverages second-order gradients and actively trains a heteroscedastic surrogate model for sample-efficient optimization. In a single-objective vector optimization application, it leads to 64.1% higher performance than the next-best baseline, random forest regression. In graph-based search, BREATHE outperforms the next-best baseline, i.e., a graphical version of Gaussian-process-based Bayesian optimization, with up to 64.9% higher performance. In a MOO task, it achieves up to 21.9$\times$ higher hypervolume than the state-of-the-art method, multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBOpt). BREATHE also outperforms the baseline methods on most standard MOO benchmark applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine for Investigation of Pressure Filtration Performance, a Zinc Plant Filter Cake Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14199v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hydrometallurgical method of zinc production involves leaching zinc from ore and then separating the solid residue from the liquid solution by pressure filtration. This separation process is very important since the solid residue contains some moisture that can reduce the amount of zinc recovered. This study modeled the pressure filtration process through Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The models take continuous variables (extracted features) from the lab samples as inputs. Thus, regression models namely Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were chosen. A total dataset was obtained during the pressure filtration process in two conditions: 1) Polypropylene (S1) and 2) Polyester fabrics (S2). To predict the cake moisture, solids concentration (0.2 and 0.38), temperature (35 and 65 centigrade), pH (2, 3.5, and 5), pressure, cake thickness (14, 20, 26, and 34 mm), air-blow time (2, 10 and 15 min) and filtration time were applied as input variables. The models' predictive accuracy was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R2) parameter. The results revealed that the RFR model is superior to the SVR model for cake moisture prediction.</p></details> |  |

Our approach incorporates an innovative data augmentation technique that involves the use of multi-layer synthetic (MLS) or quasi-2.5D images which are generated by blending 2D synthetic images. The MLS images more closely resemble 3D synthetic and real scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CNTs but without the computational cost of performing expensive 3D simulations or experiments. Mechanical properties such as stiffness and buckling load for the MLS images are estimated using a physics-based model. The proposed deep learning architecture, CNTNeXt, builds upon our previous CNTNet neural network, using a ResNeXt feature representation followed by random forest regression estimator. Our machine learning approach for predicting CNT physical properties by utilizing a blended set of synthetic images is expected to outperform single synthetic image-based learning when it comes to predicting mechanical properties of real scanning electron microscopy images. This has the potential to accelerate understanding and control of CNT forest self-assembly for diverse applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

E-bikes have gained significant popularity as a fast and eco-friendly transportation option. As we strive for a sustainable energy plan, understanding the growth and impact of e-bikes is crucial for policymakers. Our mathematical modeling offers insights into the value of e-bikes and their role in the future. Using an ARIMA model, a supervised machine-learning algorithm, we predicted the growth of e-bike sales in the U.S. Our model, trained on historical sales data from January 2006 to December 2022, projected sales of 1.3 million units in 2025 and 2.113 million units in 2028. To assess the factors contributing to e-bike usage, we employed a Random Forest regression model. The most significant factors influencing e-bike sales growth were disposable personal income and popularity. Furthermore, we examined the environmental and health impacts of e-bikes. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated the reduction in carbon emissions due to e-bike use and the calories burned through e-biking. Our findings revealed that e-bike usage in the U.S. resulted in a reduction of 15,737.82 kilograms of CO2 emissions in 2022. Additionally, e-bike users burned approximately 716,630.727 kilocalories through their activities in the same year. Our research provides valuable insights for policymakers, emphasizing the potential of e-bikes as a sustainable transportation solution. By understanding the growth factors and quantifying the environmental and health benefits, policymakers can make informed decisions about integrating e-bikes into future energy and transportation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages; Submitted to M3 Challenge.

| **[Revisiting Random Forests in a Comparative Evaluation of Graph Convolutional Neural Network Variants for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19292v1)** | 2023-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a spatiotemporal predictive task that plays an essential role in intelligent transportation systems. Today, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have become the prevailing models in the traffic prediction literature since they excel at extracting spatial correlations. In this work, we classify the components of successful GCNN prediction models and analyze the effects of matrix factorization, attention mechanism, and weight sharing on their performance. Furthermore, we compare these variations against random forests, a traditional regression method that predates GCNNs by over 15 years. We evaluated these methods using simulated data of two regions in Toronto as well as real-world sensor data from selected California highways. We found that incorporating matrix factorization, attention, and location-specific model weights either individually or collectively into GCNNs can result in a better overall performance. Moreover, although random forest regression is a less compact model, it matches or exceeds the performance of all variations of GCNNs in our experiments. This suggests that the current graph convolutional methods may not be the best approach to traffic prediction and there is still room for improvement. Finally, our findings also suggest that for future research on GCNN for traffic prediction to be credible, researchers must include performance comparison to random forests.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to out-perform default random forest regression: choosing hyperparameters for applications in large-sample hydrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07136v1)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictions are a central part of water resources research. Historically, physically-based models have been preferred; however, they have largely failed at modeling hydrological processes at a catchment scale and there are some important prediction problems that cannot be modeled physically. As such, machine learning (ML) models have been seen as a valid alternative in recent years. In spite of their availability, well-optimized state-of-the-art ML strategies are not being widely used in water resources research. This is because using state-of-the-art ML models and optimizing hyperparameters requires expert mathematical and statistical knowledge. Further, some analyses require many model trainings, so sometimes even expert statisticians cannot properly optimize hyperparameters. To leverage data and use it effectively to drive scientific advances in the field, it is essential to make ML models accessible to subject matter experts by improving automated machine learning resources. ML models such as XGBoost have been recently shown to outperform random forest (RF) models which are traditionally used in water resources research. In this study, based on over 150 water-related datasets, we extensively compare XGBoost and RF. This study provides water scientists with access to quick user-friendly RF and XGBoost model optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this research, the laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique is used for quantitative analysis of aluminum alloys by different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. The fundamental harmonic (1064 nm) of a nanosecond Nd:YAG laser pulse is employed to generate the LIBS plasma for the prediction of constituent concentrations of the aluminum standard samples.

Then a comparison is performed among prediction by classical machine learning methods of support vector regressor (SVR), the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree algorithm, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Linear Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm.

| **[Machine Learning as an Accurate Predictor for Percolation Threshold of Diverse Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14694v2)** | 2023-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The percolation threshold is an important measure to determine the inherent rigidity of large networks. Predictors of the percolation threshold for large networks are computationally intense to run, hence it is a necessity to develop predictors of the percolation threshold of networks, that do not rely on numerical simulations. We demonstrate the efficacy of five machine learning-based regression techniques for the accurate prediction of the percolation threshold. The dataset generated to train the machine learning models contains a total of 777 real and synthetic networks. It consists of 5 statistical and structural properties of networks as features and the numerically computed percolation threshold as the output attribute. We establish that the machine learning models outperform three existing empirical estimators of bond percolation threshold, and extend this experiment to predict site and explosive percolation. Further, we compared the performance of our models in predicting the percolation threshold using RMSE values. The gradient boosting regressor, multilayer perceptron and random forests regression models achieve the least RMSE values among considered models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Notion of Feature Importance by Decorrelation and Detection of Trends by Random Forest Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01156v1)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many studies, we want to determine the influence of certain features on a dependent variable. More specifically, we are interested in the strength of the influence -- i.e., is the feature relevant? -- and, if so, how the feature influences the dependent variable. Recently, data-driven approaches such as \emph{random forest regression} have found their way into applications (Boulesteix et al., 2012). These models allow to directly derive measures of feature importance, which are a natural indicator of the strength of the influence. For the relevant features, the correlation or rank correlation between the feature and the dependent variable has typically been used to determine the nature of the influence. More recent methods, some of which can also measure interactions between features, are based on a modeling approach. In particular, when machine learning models are used, SHAP scores are a recent and prominent method to determine these trends (Lundberg et al., 2017). In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feature importance based on the well-studied Gram-Schmidt decorrelation method. Furthermore, we propose two estimators for identifying trends in the data using random forest regression, the so-called absolute and relative transversal rate. We empirically compare the properties of our estimators with those of well-established estimators on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of SLAM ATE Using an Ensemble Learning Regression Model and 1-D Global Pooling of Data Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00616v1)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness and resilience of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are critical requirements for modern autonomous robotic systems. One of the essential steps to achieve robustness and resilience is the ability of SLAM to have an integrity measure for its localization estimates, and thus, have internal fault tolerance mechanisms to deal with performance degradation. In this work, we introduce a novel method for predicting SLAM localization error based on the characterization of raw sensor inputs. The proposed method relies on using a random forest regression model trained on 1-D global pooled features that are generated from characterized raw sensor data. The model is validated by using it to predict the performance of ORB-SLAM3 on three different datasets running on four different operating modes, resulting in an average prediction accuracy of up to 94.7\%. The paper also studies the impact of 12 different 1-D global pooling functions on regression quality, and the superiority of 1-D global averaging is quantitatively proven. Finally, the paper studies the quality of prediction with limited training data, and proves that we are able to maintain proper prediction quality when only 20 \% of the training examples are used for training, which highlights how the proposed model can optimize the evaluation footprint of SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of a Batter in ODI Cricket Implementing Regression Models from Match Commentary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11172v1)** | 2023-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cricket, "a Gentleman's Game", is a prominent sport rising worldwide. Due to the rising competitiveness of the sport, players and team management have become more professional with their approach. Prior studies predicted individual performance or chose the best team but did not highlight the batter's potential. On the other hand, our research aims to evaluate a player's impact while considering his control in various circumstances. This paper seeks to understand the conundrum behind this impactful performance by determining how much control a player has over the circumstances and generating the "Effective Runs",a new measure we propose. We first gathered the fundamental cricket data from open-source datasets; however, variables like pitch, weather, and control were not readily available for all matches. As a result, we compiled our corpus data by analyzing the commentary of the match summaries. This gave us an insight into the particular game's weather and pitch conditions. Furthermore, ball-by-ball inspection from the commentary led us to determine the control of the shots played by the batter. We collected data for the entire One Day International career, up to February 2022, of 3 prominent cricket players: Rohit G Sharma, David A Warner, and Kane S Williamson. Lastly, to prepare the dataset, we encoded, scaled, and split the dataset to train and test Machine Learning Algorithms. We used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression on each player's data individually to train them and predict the Impact the player will have on the game. Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest give the best predictions accuracy of 90.16 percent and 87.12 percent, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-Learning Prediction of the Computed Band Gaps of Double Perovskite Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03372v1)** | 2023-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of the electronic structure of functional materials is essential for the engineering of new devices. Conventional electronic structure prediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not only high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based on machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to bypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band gaps, which motivated this research study. Herein, we construct a random forest regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation) functional. Among the 20 physical features employed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and cation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with the physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features, a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained, comparable to previous studies. Our results are significant in the sense that they attest to the potential of machine learning regressions for the rapid screening of promising candidate functional materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Automated Design of Bayesian Optimization via Exploratory Landscape Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09678v1)** | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms form a class of surrogate-based heuristics, aimed at efficiently computing high-quality solutions for numerical black-box optimization problems. The BO pipeline is highly modular, with different design choices for the initial sampling strategy, the surrogate model, the acquisition function (AF), the solver used to optimize the AF, etc. We demonstrate in this work that a dynamic selection of the AF can benefit the BO design. More precisely, we show that already a naïve random forest regression model, built on top of exploratory landscape analysis features that are computed from the initial design points, suffices to recommend AFs that outperform any static choice, when considering performance over the classic BBOB benchmark suite for derivative-free numerical optimization methods on the COCO platform. Our work hence paves a way towards AutoML-assisted, on-the-fly BO designs that adjust their behavior on a run-by-run basis.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th W...</summary><p>6th Workshop on Meta-Learning at NeurIPS 2022, New Orleans</p></details> |
| **[Predicting housing prices and analyzing real estate market in the Chicago suburbs using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06261v1)** | 2022-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pricing of housing properties is determined by a variety of factors. However, post-pandemic markets have experienced volatility in the Chicago suburb area, which have affected house prices greatly. In this study, analysis was done on the Naperville/Bolingbrook real estate market to predict property prices based on these housing attributes through machine learning models, and to evaluate the effectiveness of such models in a volatile market space. Gathering data from Redfin, a real estate website, sales data from 2018 up until the summer season of 2022 were collected for research. By analyzing these sales in this range of time, we can also look at the state of the housing market and identify trends in price. For modeling the data, the models used were linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and XGBoost regression. To analyze results, comparison was made on the MAE, RMSE, and R-squared values for each model. It was found that the XGBoost model performs the best in predicting house prices despite the additional volatility sponsored by post-pandemic conditions. After modeling, Shapley Values (SHAP) were used to evaluate the weights of the variables in constructing models.</p></details> |  |
