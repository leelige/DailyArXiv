| **[Is Large Language Model Good at Database Knob Tuning? A Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02213v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance. However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific. Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored. This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask. We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain. Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments. Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner. We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications. Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMIT: Micro-Invasive Database Configuration Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00616v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of database knob tuning has always been a challenging task. Recently, database knob tuning methods has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, these methods still face certain limitations.On one hand, when applying knob tuning algorithms to optimize databases in practice, it either requires frequent updates to the database or necessitates acquiring database workload and optimizing through workload replay. The former approach involves constant exploration and updating of database configurations, inevitably leading to a decline in database performance during optimization. The latter, on the other hand, requires the acquisition of workload data, which could lead to data leakage issues. Moreover, the hyperparameter configuration space for database knobs is vast, making it challenging for optimizers to converge. These factors significantly hinder the practical implementation of database tuning. To address these concerns, we proposes an efficient and micro-invasive knob tuning method. This method relies on workload synthesis on cloned databases to simulate the workload that needs tuning, thus minimizing the intrusion on the database. And we utilizing a configuration replacement strategy to filter configuration candidates that perform well under the synthesized workload to find best configuration. And during the tuning process, we employ a knowledge transfer method to extract a common high-performance space, to boost the convergence of the optimizer.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnobCF: Uncertainty-aware Knob Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02803v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The knob tuning aims to optimize database performance by searching for the most effective knob configuration under a certain workload. Existing works suffer two significant problems. On the one hand, there exist multiple similar even useless evaluations of knob tuning even with the diverse searching methods because of the different sensitivities of knobs on a certain workload. On the other hand, the single evaluation of knob configurations may bring overestimation or underestimation because of the query uncertainty performance. To solve the above problems, we propose a decoupled query uncertainty-aware knob classifier, called KnobCF, to enhance the knob tuning. Our method has three significant contributions: (1) We propose a novel concept of the uncertainty-aware knob configuration estimation to enhance the knob tuning process. (2) We provide an effective few-shot uncertainty knob estimator without extra time consumption in training data collection, which has a high time efficiency in practical tuning tasks. (3) Our method provides a general framework that could be easily deployed in any knob tuning task because we make no changes to the knob tuners and the database management system. Our experiments on four open-source benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively reduces useless evaluations and improves the tuning results. Especially in TPCC, our method achieves competitive tuning results with only 60% to 70% time consumption compared to the full workload evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCTuner: Spatial Decomposition-Enhanced Database Tuning via LLM-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06298v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of modern database management systems, which often expose hundreds of knobs with continuous or categorical values. However, the large number of knobs and the vast configuration space make it difficult to identify optimal settings efficiently. Although learning-based tuning has shown promise, existing approaches either ignore domain knowledge by relying solely on benchmark feedback or struggle to explore the high-dimensional knob space, resulting in high tuning costs and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MCTuner, an adaptive knob tuning framework that minimizes exploration in ineffective regions of the configuration space. MCTuner employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with specialized LLMs to identify performance-critical knobs. In further, MCTuner introduces the first spatial decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space into hierarchical subspaces, on which Bayesian Optimization is performed to efficiently search for near-optimal configurations. Evaluated on different benchmarks (OLAP, OLTP, and HTAP), MCTuner achieves up to 19.2% performance gains and 1.4x faster configuration discovery per iteration compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPTuner: A Manual-Reading Database Tuning System via GPT-Guided Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03157v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern database management systems (DBMS) expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviours. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance is a long-standing problem in the database community. As there is an increasing number of knobs to tune and each knob could be in continuous or categorical values, manual tuning becomes impractical. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods have shown great potentials. However, existing approaches still incur significant tuning costs or only yield sub-optimal performance. This is because they either ignore the extensive domain knowledge available (e.g., DBMS manuals and forum discussions) and only rely on the runtime feedback of benchmark evaluations to guide the optimization, or they utilize the domain knowledge in a limited way. Hence, we propose GPTuner, a manual-reading database tuning system. Firstly, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline to collect and refine heterogeneous knowledge, and propose a prompt ensemble algorithm to unify a structured view of the refined knowledge. Secondly, using the structured knowledge, we (1) design a workload-aware and training-free knob selection strategy, (2) develop a search space optimization technique considering the value range of each knob, and (3) propose a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space. Finally, we evaluate GPTuner under different benchmarks (TPC-C and TPC-H), metrics (throughput and latency) as well as DBMS (PostgreSQL and MySQL). Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, GPTuner identifies better configurations in 16x less time on average. Moreover, GPTuner achieves up to 30% performance improvement (higher throughput or lower latency) over the best-performing alternative.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2024 |
| **[E2ETune: End-to-End Knob Tuning via Fine-tuned Generative Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11581v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is a significant challenge for database administrators, as it involves tuning a large number of configuration knobs with continuous or discrete values to achieve optimal database performance. Traditional methods, such as manual tuning or learning-based approaches, typically require numerous workload replays and are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce E2ETune, an end-to-end knob tuner powered by a fine-tuned generative language model. The key idea is to leverage the exceptional sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of generative language models to capture the complex mapping between workloads (inputs) and their corresponding promising configurations (outputs). To achieve this goal, we propose a novel data generation framework to efficiently produce a large amount of training data, where each data sample consists of a workload and its promising configuration. Then, these data are used to fine-tune a generative language model, yielding an end-to-end knob tuner. This tuner offers out-of-the-box configuration recommendations for new workloads. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate E2ETune's efficiency and effectiveness using 10 representative and 3 real-world benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, E2ETune can identify competitive configurations in significantly less time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[LlamaTune: Sample-Efficient DBMS Configuration Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05128v2)** | 2022-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuning a database system to achieve optimal performance on a given workload is a long-standing problem in the database community. A number of recent works have leveraged ML-based approaches to guide the sampling of large parameter spaces (hundreds of tuning knobs) in search for high performance configurations. Looking at Microsoft production services operating millions of databases, sample efficiency emerged as a crucial requirement to use tuners on diverse workloads. This motivates our investigation in LlamaTune, a tuner design that leverages domain knowledge to improve the sample efficiency of existing optimizers. LlamaTune employs an automated dimensionality reduction technique based on randomized projections, a biased-sampling approach to handle special values for certain knobs, and knob values bucketization, to reduce the size of the search space. LlamaTune compares favorably with the state-of-the-art optimizers across a diverse set of workloads. It identifies the best performing configurations with up to $11\times$ fewer workload runs, and reaching up to $21\%$ higher throughput. We also show that benefits from LlamaTune generalize across both BO-based and RL-based optimizers, as well as different DBMS versions. While the journey to perform database tuning at cloud-scale remains long, LlamaTune goes a long way in making automatic DBMS tuning practical at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 15 (VLDB'22)</p></details> |
| **[L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01602v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep learning based Auto Tuning for Database Management System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12747v1)** | 2023-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The management of database system configurations is a challenging task, as there are hundreds of configuration knobs that control every aspect of the system. This is complicated by the fact that these knobs are not standardized, independent, or universal, making it difficult to determine optimal settings. An automated approach to address this problem using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to select impactful knobs, map unseen workloads, and recommend knob settings was implemented in a new tool called OtterTune and is being evaluated on three DBMSs, with results demonstrating that it recommends configurations as good as or better than those generated by existing tools or a human expert.In this work, we extend an automated technique based on Ottertune [1] to reuse training data gathered from previous sessions to tune new DBMS deployments with the help of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to improve latency prediction. Our approach involves the expansion of the methods proposed in the original paper. We use GMM clustering to prune metrics and combine ensemble models, such as RandomForest, with non-linear models, like neural networks, for prediction modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Dynamic and Safe Configuration Tuning for Cloud Databases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14473v1)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration knobs of database systems are essential to achieve high throughput and low latency. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods (ML) have shown to find better configurations compared to experienced database administrators (DBAs). However, there are still gaps to apply the existing systems in production environments, especially in the cloud. First, they conduct tuning for a given workload within a limited time window and ignore the dynamicity of workloads and data. Second, they rely on a copied instance and do not consider the availability of the database when sampling configurations, making the tuning expensive, delayed, and unsafe. To fill these gaps, we propose OnlineTune, which tunes the online databases safely in changing cloud environments. To accommodate the dynamicity, OnlineTune embeds the environmental factors as context feature and adopts contextual Bayesian Optimization with context space partition to optimize the database adaptively and scalably. To pursue safety during tuning, we leverage the black-box and the white-box knowledge to evaluate the safety of configurations and propose a safe exploration strategy via subspace adaptation.%, greatly decreasing the risks of applying bad configurations. We conduct evaluations on dynamic workloads from benchmarks and real-world workloads. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, OnlineTune achieves 14.4%~165.3% improvement on cumulative performance while reducing 91.0%~99.5% unsafe configuration recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Configuration Tuning on Cloud Database: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06043v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faced with the challenges of big data, modern cloud database management systems are designed to efficiently store, organize, and retrieve data, supporting optimal performance, scalability, and reliability for complex data processing and analysis. However, achieving good performance in modern databases is non-trivial as they are notorious for having dozens of configurable knobs, such as hardware setup, software setup, database physical and logical design, etc., that control runtime behaviors and impact database performance. To find the optimal configuration for achieving optimal performance, extensive research has been conducted on automatic parameter tuning in DBMS. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of predominant configuration tuning techniques, including Bayesian optimization-based solutions, Neural network-based solutions, Reinforcement learning-based solutions, and Search-based solutions. Moreover, it investigates the fundamental aspects of parameter tuning pipeline, including tuning objective, workload characterization, feature pruning, knowledge from experience, configuration recommendation, and experimental settings. We highlight technique comparisons in each component, corresponding solutions, and introduce the experimental setting for performance evaluation. Finally, we conclude this paper and present future research opportunities. This paper aims to assist future researchers and practitioners in gaining a better understanding of automatic parameter tuning in cloud databases by providing state-of-the-art existing solutions, research directions, and evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenBox: A Python Toolkit for Generalized Black-box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13339v3)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box optimization (BBO) has a broad range of applications, including automatic machine learning, experimental design, and database knob tuning. However, users still face challenges when applying BBO methods to their problems at hand with existing software packages in terms of applicability, performance, and efficiency. This paper presents OpenBox, an open-source BBO toolkit with improved usability. It implements user-friendly interfaces and visualization for users to define and manage their tasks. The modular design behind OpenBox facilitates its flexible deployment in existing systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OpenBox over existing systems.

| **[A Unified and Efficient Coordinating Framework for Autonomous DBMS Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05710v1)** | 2023-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently using machine learning (ML) based techniques to optimize modern database management systems has attracted intensive interest from both industry and academia. With an objective to tune a specific component of a DBMS (e.g., index selection, knobs tuning), the ML-based tuning agents have shown to be able to find better configurations than experienced database administrators. However, one critical yet challenging question remains unexplored -- how to make those ML-based tuning agents work collaboratively. Existing methods do not consider the dependencies among the multiple agents, and the model used by each agent only studies the effect of changing the configurations in a single component. To tune different components for DBMS, a coordinating mechanism is needed to make the multiple agents cognizant of each other. Also, we need to decide how to allocate the limited tuning budget among the agents to maximize the performance. Such a decision is difficult to make since the distribution of the reward for each agent is unknown and non-stationary. In this paper, we study the above question and present a unified coordinating framework to efficiently utilize existing ML-based agents. First, we propose a message propagation protocol that specifies the collaboration behaviors for agents and encapsulates the global tuning messages in each agent's model. Second, we combine Thompson Sampling, a well-studied reinforcement learning algorithm with a memory buffer so that our framework can allocate budget judiciously in a non-stationary environment. Our framework defines the interfaces adapted to a broad class of ML-based tuning agents, yet simple enough for integration with existing implementations and future extensions. We show that it can effectively utilize different ML-based agents and find better configurations with 1.4~14.1X speedups on the workload execution time compared with baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2023 International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD '23)</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Co-Processing for Hash Joins on the Coupled CPU-GPU Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1955v1)** | 2016-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query co-processing on graphics processors (GPUs) has become an effective means to improve the performance of main memory databases. However, the relatively low bandwidth and high latency of the PCI-e bus are usually bottleneck issues for co-processing. Recently, coupled CPU-GPU architectures have received a lot of attention, e.g. AMD APUs with the CPU and the GPU integrated into a single chip. That opens up new opportunities for optimizing query co-processing. In this paper, we experimentally revisit hash joins, one of the most important join algorithms for main memory databases, on a coupled CPU-GPU architecture. Particularly, we study the fine-grained co-processing mechanisms on hash joins with and without partitioning. The co-processing outlines an interesting design space. We extend existing cost models to automatically guide decisions on the design space. Our experimental results on a recent AMD APU show that (1) the coupled architecture enables fine-grained co-processing and cache reuses, which are inefficient on discrete CPU-GPU architectures; (2) the cost model can automatically guide the design and tuning knobs in the design space; (3) fine-grained co-processing achieves up to 53%, 35% and 28% performance improvement over CPU-only, GPU-only and conventional CPU-GPU co-processing, respectively. We believe that the insights and implications from this study are initial yet important for further research on query co-processing on coupled CPU-GPU architectures.</p></details> | 14 pages, 20 figures |

| **[AQETuner: Reliable Query-level Configuration Tuning for Analytical Query Engines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11756v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern analytical query engines (AQEs) are essential for large-scale data analysis and processing. These systems usually provide numerous query-level tunable knobs that significantly affect individual query performance. While several studies have explored automatic DBMS configuration tuning, they have several limitations to handle query-level tuning. Firstly, they fail to capture how knobs influence query plans, which directly affect query performance. Secondly, they overlook query failures during the tuning processing, resulting in low tuning efficiency. Thirdly, they struggle with cold-start problems for new queries, leading to prolonged tuning time. To address these challenges, we propose AQETuner, a novel Bayesian Optimization-based system tailored for reliable query-level knob tuning in AQEs. AQETuner first applies the attention mechanisms to jointly encode the knobs and plan query, effectively identifying the impact of knobs on plan nodes. Then, AQETuner employs a dual-task Neural Process to predict both query performance and failures, leveraging their interactions to guide the tuning process. Furthermore, AQETuner utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization to efficiently generate high-quality samples in parallel during the initial tuning stage for the new queries. Experimental results show that AQETuner significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing query latency by up to 23.7% and query failures by up to 51.2%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget-aware Query Tuning: An AutoML Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00137v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern database systems rely on cost-based query optimizers to come up with good execution plans for input queries. Such query optimizers rely on cost models to estimate the costs of candidate query execution plans. A cost model represents a function from a set of cost units to query execution cost, where each cost unit specifies the unit cost of executing a certain type of query processing operation (such as table scan or join). These cost units are traditionally viewed as constants, whose values only depend on the platform configuration where the database system runs on top of but are invariant for queries processed by the database system. In this paper, we challenge this classic view by thinking of these cost units as variables instead. We show that, by varying the cost-unit values one can obtain query plans that significantly outperform the default query plans returned by the query optimizer when viewing the cost units as constants. We term this cost-unit tuning process "query tuning" (QT) and show that it is similar to the well-known hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) problem in AutoML. As a result, any state-of-the-art HPO technologies can be applied to QT. We study the QT problem in the context of anytime tuning, which is desirable in practice by constraining the total time spent on QT within a given budget -- we call this problem budget-aware query tuning. We further extend our study from tuning a single query to tuning a workload with multiple queries, and we call this generalized problem budget-aware workload tuning (WT), which aims for minimizing the execution time of the entire workload. WT is more challenging as one needs to further prioritize individual query tuning within the given time budget. We propose solutions to both QT and WT and experimental evaluation using both benchmark and real workloads demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEFRQO: A Self-Evolving Fine-Tuned RAG-Based Query Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17556v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query optimization is a crucial problem in database systems that has been studied for decades. Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance over time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start issues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change. Recent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning and execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we present SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO mitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from execution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We employ both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the LLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints. Moreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by dynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the historical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm iteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency. Evaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to 65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads, respectively, compared to PostgreSQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SIGMOD 2026 (https://2026.sigmod.org/)</p></details> |
| **[Preserving Multilingual Quality While Tuning Query Encoder on English Only](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00923v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A query encoder of a dual passage retrieval system can be tuned for specific types of queries or domains, while the precomputed and stored documents representations are kept intact. Switching from one query encoder to another when needed is easily feasible, unlike overhauling the embeddings of a whole knowledge base. In this work we raise a question: Can the generic, original qualities of the encoder be preserved or at least left not too degraded when it is tuned on a narrow domain? We conducted experiments on a high quality multilingual embedding model: Tuning it on a single English-only dataset, we observe that the tuning not only preserves the multilingual qualities, but even improves them. The embedding qualities on distinctly different data are also improved or at least preserved. Drawing on our observations, we suggest a more general hypothesis: Tuning with intentionally low learning rate can preserve or improve a system's properties acquired in training, but not specifically targeted by tuning. We call this adiabatic tuning and provide tentative explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Comparative Exploration of ML Techniques for Tuning Query Degree of Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08439v2)** | 2020-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a large body of recent work applying machine learning (ML) techniques to query optimization and query performance prediction in relational database management systems (RDBMSs). However, these works typically ignore the effect of \textit{intra-parallelism} -- a key component used to boost the performance of OLAP queries in practice -- on query performance prediction. In this paper, we take a first step towards filling this gap by studying the problem of \textit{tuning the degree of parallelism (DOP) via ML techniques} in Microsoft SQL Server, a popular commercial RDBMS that allows an individual query to execute using multiple cores. In our study, we cast the problem of DOP tuning as a {\em regression} task, and examine how several popular ML models can help with query performance prediction in a multi-core setting. We explore the design space and perform an extensive experimental study comparing different models against a list of performance metrics, testing how well they generalize in different settings: $(i)$ to queries from the same template, $(ii)$ to queries from a new template, $(iii)$ to instances of different scale, and $(iv)$ to different instances and queries. Our experimental results show that a simple featurization of the input query plan that ignores cost model estimations can accurately predict query performance, capture the speedup trend with respect to the available parallelism, as well as help with automatically choosing an optimal per-query DOP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Language Models for Context-Specific SQL Query Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02251v1)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate SQL queries from natural language has significant implications for making data accessible to non-specialists. This paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning open-source large language models (LLMs) for the task of transforming natural language into SQL queries within the retail domain. We introduce models specialized in generating SQL queries, trained on synthetic datasets tailored to the Snowflake SQL and GoogleSQL dialects. Our methodology involves generating a context-specific dataset using GPT-4, then fine-tuning three open-source LLMs(Starcoder Plus, Code-Llama, and Mistral) employing the LoRa technique to optimize for resource constraints. The fine-tuned models demonstrate superior performance in zero-shot settings compared to the baseline GPT-4, with Code-Llama achieving the highest accuracy rates, at 81.58% for Snowflake SQL and 82.66% for GoogleSQL. These results underscore the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific tasks and suggest a promising direction for enhancing the accessibility of relational databases through natural language interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning the Tail Latency of Distributed Queries Using Replication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10387v1)** | 2022-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Querying graph data with low latency is an important requirement in application domains such as social networks and knowledge graphs. Graph queries perform multiple hops between vertices. When data is partitioned and stored across multiple servers, queries executing at one server often need to hop to vertices stored by another server. Such distributed traversals represent a performance bottleneck for low-latency queries. To reduce query latency, one can replicate remote data to make distributed traversals unnecessary, but replication is expensive and should be minimized. In this paper, we introduce the problem of finding data replication schemes that satisfy arbitrary user-defined query latency constraints with minimal replication cost. We propose a novel workload model to express data access causality, propose a family of heuristics, and introduce non-trivial sufficient conditions for their correctness. Our evaluation on two representative benchmarks show that our algorithms enable fine-tuning query latency with data replication and can find sweet spots in the latency/replication design space.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An earlier version of this paper was submitted in April 2022.

| **[AdvQDet: Detecting Query-Based Adversarial Attacks with Adversarial Contrastive Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01978v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks even under a black-box setting where the adversary can only query the model. Particularly, query-based black-box adversarial attacks estimate adversarial gradients based on the returned probability vectors of the target model for a sequence of queries. During this process, the queries made to the target model are intermediate adversarial examples crafted at the previous attack step, which share high similarities in the pixel space. Motivated by this observation, stateful detection methods have been proposed to detect and reject query-based attacks. While demonstrating promising results, these methods either have been evaded by more advanced attacks or suffer from low efficiency in terms of the number of shots (queries) required to detect different attacks. Arguably, the key challenge here is to assign high similarity scores for any two intermediate adversarial examples perturbed from the same clean image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Adversarial Contrastive Prompt Tuning (ACPT) method to robustly fine-tune the CLIP image encoder to extract similar embeddings for any two intermediate adversarial queries. With ACPT, we further introduce a detection framework AdvQDet that can detect 7 state-of-the-art query-based attacks with $>99\%$ detection rate within 5 shots. We also show that ACPT is robust to 3 types of adaptive attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/xinwong/AdvQDet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Query Focused Summaries without Fine-tuning the Transformer-based Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06230v1)** | 2023-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning the Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for each new data set requires higher computational time associated with increased carbon footprint and cost. However, fine-tuning helps the pre-trained models adapt to the latest data sets; what if we avoid the fine-tuning steps and attempt to generate summaries using just the pre-trained models to reduce computational time and cost. In this paper, we tried to omit the fine-tuning steps and investigate whether the Marginal Maximum Relevance (MMR)-based approach can help the pre-trained models to obtain query-focused summaries directly from a new data set that was not used to pre-train the models. First, we used topic modelling on Wikipedia Current Events Portal (WCEP) and Debatepedia datasets to generate queries for summarization tasks. Then, using MMR, we ranked the sentences of the documents according to the queries. Next, we passed the ranked sentences to seven transformer-based pre-trained models to perform the summarization tasks. Finally, we used the MMR approach again to select the query relevant sentences from the generated summaries of individual pre-trained models and constructed the final summary. As indicated by the experimental results, our MMR-based approach successfully ranked and selected the most relevant sentences as summaries and showed better performance than the individual pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a query-dependent parameter efficient fine-tuning (Q-PEFT) approach for text reranking to leak the information of the true queries to LLMs and then make the generation of true queries from input documents much easier. Specifically, we utilize the query to extract the top-$k$ tokens from concatenated documents, serving as contextual clues. We further augment Q-PEFT by substituting the retrieval mechanism with a multi-head attention layer to achieve end-to-end training and cover all the tokens in the documents, guiding the LLMs to generate more document-specific synthetic queries, thereby further improving the reranking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

The method aims to address the limitations of the bi-encoder architecture while maintaining a minimal additional training burden. The approach involves labeling top products for each query, generating semantically similar query clusters using the K-Means clustering algorithm, and fine-tuning a global language model into cluster language models on individual clusters. The parameters of each cluster language model are fine-tuned to learn local manifolds in the feature space efficiently, capturing the nuances of various query types within each cluster. The inference is performed by assigning a new query to its respective cluster and utilizing the corresponding cluster language model for retrieval. The proposed method results in more accurate and personalized retrieval results, offering a superior alternative to the popular bi-encoder based retrieval models in semantic search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 6th Workshop on e-Commerce and NLP (ECNLP 6), KDD'23, Long Beach, CA</p></details> |
| **[From Misleading Queries to Accurate Answers: A Three-Stage Fine-Tuning Method for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11277v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent performance in natural language processing (NLP), but remain highly sensitive to the quality of input queries, especially when these queries contain misleading or inaccurate information. Existing methods focus on correcting the output, but they often overlook the potential of improving the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading content in the input itself. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading information in the input, further improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include (1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to correct the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and (3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the hallucination detection task and the question answering~(QA) task, as well as two datasets containing misleading information that we constructed. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and factuality of LLM responses, while also enhancing the ability to detect hallucinations and reducing the generation of hallucinations in the output, particularly when the query contains misleading information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

The key challenge is how to utilize these intermediate features given their gigantic amount. We propose visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers. Through introducing a handful of learnable ``query'' tokens to each layer, VQT leverages the inner workings of Transformers to ``summarize'' rich intermediate features of each layer, which can then be used to train the prediction heads of downstream tasks. As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learns to combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to many other parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt features and need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests the complementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning. Empirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach that utilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms full fine-tuning in many cases. Compared to parameter-efficient approaches that adapt features, VQT achieves much higher accuracy under memory constraints. Most importantly, VQT is compatible with these approaches to attain even higher accuracy, making it a simple add-on to further boost transfer learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2023.

This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation and query-document relations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however, these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii) semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG, one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs, SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching 0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the test set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 17th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (IC3K)</p></details> |
| **[LoFT: Local Proxy Fine-tuning For Improving Transferability Of Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04445v2)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been shown that Large Language Model (LLM) alignments can be circumvented by appending specially crafted attack suffixes with harmful queries to elicit harmful responses. To conduct attacks against private target models whose characterization is unknown, public models can be used as proxies to fashion the attack, with successful attacks being transferred from public proxies to private target models. The success rate of attack depends on how closely the proxy model approximates the private model. We hypothesize that for attacks to be transferrable, it is sufficient if the proxy can approximate the target model in the neighborhood of the harmful query. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \emph{Local Fine-Tuning (LoFT)}, \textit{i.e.}, fine-tuning proxy models on similar queries that lie in the lexico-semantic neighborhood of harmful queries to decrease the divergence between the proxy and target models. First, we demonstrate three approaches to prompt private target models to obtain similar queries given harmful queries. Next, we obtain data for local fine-tuning by eliciting responses from target models for the generated similar queries. Then, we optimize attack suffixes to generate attack prompts and evaluate the impact of our local fine-tuning on the attack's success rate. Experiments show that local fine-tuning of proxy models improves attack transferability and increases attack success rate by $39\%$, $7\%$, and $0.5\%$ (absolute) on target models ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude respectively.</p></details> |  |

Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Combing for Credentials: Active Pattern Extraction from Smart Reply](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10802v3)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained large language models, such as GPT\nobreakdash-2 and BERT, are often fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a downstream task. One natural example is the ``Smart Reply'' application where a pre-trained model is tuned to provide suggested responses for a given query message. Since the tuning data is often sensitive data such as emails or chat transcripts, it is important to understand and mitigate the risk that the model leaks its tuning data. We investigate potential information leakage vulnerabilities in a typical Smart Reply pipeline. We consider a realistic setting where the adversary can only interact with the underlying model through a front-end interface that constrains what types of queries can be sent to the model. Previous attacks do not work in these settings, but require the ability to send unconstrained queries directly to the model. Even when there are no constraints on the queries, previous attacks typically require thousands, or even millions, of queries to extract useful information, while our attacks can extract sensitive data in just a handful of queries. We introduce a new type of active extraction attack that exploits canonical patterns in text containing sensitive data. We show experimentally that it is possible for an adversary to extract sensitive user information present in the training data, even in realistic settings where all interactions with the model must go through a front-end that limits the types of queries. We explore potential mitigation strategies and demonstrate empirically how differential privacy appears to be a reasonably effective defense mechanism to such pattern extraction attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[StruQ: Defending Against Prompt Injection with Structured Queries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06363v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable exciting LLM-integrated applications, which perform text-based tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model into deviating from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/StruQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at USENIX Security Symposium 2025.

They rely on learning text representations through an encoder and usually require supervised modeling via labelled data which can be costly to obtain or simply unavailable. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised text representation learning technique via instruction-tuning the pre-trained encoder-decoder large language models (LLM) under the dual-encoder retrieval framework. We demonstrate the corpus representation can be augmented by the representations of relevant synthetic queries generated by the instruct-tuned LLM founded on the Rao-Blackwell theorem. Furthermore, we effectively align the query and corpus text representation with self-instructed-tuning. Specifically, we first prompt an open-box pre-trained LLM to follow defined instructions (i.e. question generation and keyword summarization) to generate synthetic queries. Next, we fine-tune the pre-trained LLM with defined instructions and the generated queries that passed quality check. Finally, we generate synthetic queries with the instruction-tuned LLM for each corpora and represent each corpora by weighted averaging the synthetic queries and original corpora embeddings. We evaluate our proposed method under low-resource settings on three English and one German retrieval datasets measuring NDCG@10, MRR@100, Recall@100. We significantly improve the average zero-shot retrieval performance on all metrics, increasing open-box FLAN-T5 model variations by [3.34%, 3.50%] in absolute and exceeding three competitive dense retrievers (i.e. mDPR, T-Systems, mBART-Large), with model of size at least 38% smaller, by 1.96%, 4.62%, 9.52% absolute on NDCG@10.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DCAI24 workshop@CIKM2024</p></details> |

Between the two, bi-encoder is highly efficient because all the documents can be pre-processed before the actual query time. In this work, we show two approaches for improving the performance of BERT-based bi-encoders. The first approach is to replace the full fine-tuning step with a lightweight fine-tuning. We examine lightweight fine-tuning methods that are adapter-based, prompt-based, and hybrid of the two. The second approach is to develop semi-Siamese models where queries and documents are handled with a limited amount of difference. The limited difference is realized by learning two lightweight fine-tuning modules, where the main language model of BERT is kept common for both query and document. We provide extensive experiment results for monoBERT, TwinBERT, and ColBERT where three performance metrics are evaluated over Robust04, ClueWeb09b, and MS-MARCO datasets. The results confirm that both lightweight fine-tuning and semi-Siamese are considerably helpful for improving BERT-based bi-encoders. In fact, lightweight fine-tuning is helpful for crossencoder, too</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

When stored in a graph database, the Cypher query language enables efficient modeling and querying of knowledge graphs. However, using Cypher requires specialized knowledge, which can present a challenge for non-expert users. Our work Text2Cypher aims to bridge this gap by translating natural language queries into Cypher query language and extending the utility of knowledge graphs to non-technical expert users. While large language models (LLMs) can be used for this purpose, they often struggle to capture complex nuances, resulting in incomplete or incorrect outputs. Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets has proven to be a more promising approach, but the limited availability of high-quality, publicly available Text2Cypher datasets makes this challenging. In this work, we show how we combined, cleaned and organized several publicly available datasets into a total of 44,387 instances, enabling effective fine-tuning and evaluation. Models fine-tuned on this dataset showed significant performance gains, with improvements in Google-BLEU and Exact Match scores over baseline models, highlighting the importance of high-quality datasets and fine-tuning in improving Text2Cypher performance.</p></details> |  |

Previous work in PSC either directly uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers' performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Prior work has shown that fine-tuning with queries generated using a dataset's retrieval corpus can boost retrieval effectiveness for the dataset. However, we find that surprisingly, fine-tuning using the conventional InfoNCE contrastive loss often reduces effectiveness in state-of-the-art models. To overcome this, we revisit cross-encoder listwise distillation and demonstrate that, unlike using contrastive learning alone, listwise distillation can help more consistently improve retrieval effectiveness across multiple datasets. Additionally, we show that synthesizing more training data using diverse query types (such as claims, keywords, and questions) yields greater effectiveness than using any single query type alone, regardless of the query type used in evaluation. Our findings further indicate that synthetic queries offer comparable utility to human-written queries for training. We use our approach to train an embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness among BERT embedding models. We release our model and both query generation and training code to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version of arxiv:2502.19712</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel method for fine-tuning neural rankers that can significantly improve their robustness to out-of-domain data and query perturbations. Specifically, a contrastive loss that compares data points in the representation space is combined with the standard ranking loss during fine-tuning. We use relevance labels to denote similar/dissimilar pairs, which allows the model to learn the underlying matching semantics across different query-document pairs and leads to improved robustness. In experiments with four passage ranking datasets, the proposed contrastive fine-tuning method obtains improvements on robustness to query reformulations, noise perturbations, and zero-shot transfer for both BERT and BART based rankers. Additionally, our experiments show that contrastive fine-tuning outperforms data augmentation for robustifying neural rankers.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in tuning have led to breakthroughs in optimizing over the possible configurations. However, due to their design and inability to leverage query-level historical insights, existing automated tuners struggle to adapt and re-optimize the DBMS when the environment changes (e.g., workload drift, schema transfer). This paper presents the Booster framework that assists existing tuners in adapting to environment changes (e.g., drift, cross-schema transfer). Booster structures historical artifacts into query-configuration contexts, prompts large language models (LLMs) to suggest configurations for each query based on relevant contexts, and then composes the query-level suggestions into a holistic configuration with beam search. With multiple OLAP workloads, we evaluate Booster's ability to assist different state-of-the-art tuners (e.g., cost-/machine learning-/LLM-based) in adapting to environment changes. By composing recommendations derived from query-level insights, Booster assists tuners in discovering configurations that are up to 74% better and in up to 4.7x less time than the alternative approach of continuing to tune from historical configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD2026</p></details> |

Debunking Performance Myths in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11201v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the unique capability to understand and generate human-like text from input queries. When fine-tuned, these models show enhanced performance on domain-specific queries. OpenAI highlights the process of fine-tuning, stating: "To fine-tune a model, you are required to provide at least 10 examples. We typically see clear improvements from fine-tuning on 50 to 100 training examples, but the right number varies greatly based on the exact use case." This study extends this concept to the integration of LLMs within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, which aim to improve accuracy and relevance by leveraging external corpus data for information retrieval. However, RAG's promise of delivering optimal responses often falls short in complex query scenarios. This study aims to specifically examine the effects of fine-tuning LLMs on their ability to extract and integrate contextual data to enhance the performance of RAG systems across multiple domains. We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the LLMs' capacity for data extraction and contextual understanding by comparing the accuracy and completeness of fine-tuned models against baseline performances across datasets from multiple domains. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning resulted in a decline in performance compared to the baseline models, contrary to the improvements observed in standalone LLM applications as suggested by OpenAI. This study highlights the need for vigorous investigation and validation of fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Code Search without Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07740v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search aims to retrieve semantically relevant code snippets for natural language queries. While pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance in this task, they struggle in cross-domain scenarios, often requiring costly fine-tuning or facing performance drops in zero-shot settings. RAPID, which generates synthetic data for model fine-tuning, is currently the only effective method for zero-shot cross-domain code search. Despite its effectiveness, RAPID demands substantial computational resources for fine-tuning and needs to maintain specialized models for each domain, underscoring the need for a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for cross-domain code search. The key to tackling zero-shot cross-domain code search lies in bridging the gaps among domains. In this work, we propose to break the query-code matching process of code search into two simpler tasks: query-comment matching and code-code matching. Our empirical study reveals the strong complementarity among the three matching schemas in zero-shot cross-domain settings, i.e., query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching. Based on the findings, we propose CodeBridge, a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for cross-domain code search. Specifically, CodeBridge uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate comments and pseudo-code, then combines query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching via PLM-based similarity scoring and sampling-based fusion. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art PLM-based code search approaches, i.e., CoCoSoDa and UniXcoder, by an average of 21.4% and 24.9% in MRR, respectively, across three datasets. Our approach also yields results that are better than or comparable to those of the zero-shot cross-domain code search approach RAPID, which requires costly fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Semantic Query Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07835v1)** | 2017-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query Segmentation is one of the critical components for understanding users' search intent in Information Retrieval tasks. It involves grouping tokens in the search query into meaningful phrases which help downstream tasks like search relevance and query understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to segment user queries using distributed query embeddings. Our key contribution is a supervised approach to the segmentation task using low-dimensional feature vectors for queries, getting rid of traditional hand tuned and heuristic NLP features which are quite expensive. We benchmark on a 50,000 human-annotated web search engine query corpus achieving comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques. The advantage of our technique is its fast and does not use external knowledge-base like Wikipedia for score boosting. This helps us generalize our approach to other domains like eCommerce without any fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on another 50,000 human-annotated eCommerce query corpus from eBay search logs. Our approach is easy to implement and generalizes well across different search domains proving the power of low-dimensional embeddings in query segmentation task, opening up a new direction of research for this problem.</p></details> |  |

Traditional optimizers heavily rely on a certain cost model constructed by various heuristics and empirical tuning, probably leading to generating suboptimal plans. Recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in solving complex planning and decision-making problems, such as arithmetic and programmatic tasks. In this paper, we try to explore the potential of LLMs in handling query optimization and propose a tentative LLM-based query optimizer dubbed LLM-QO, established on PostgreSQL's execution engine. In LLM-QO, we formulate query optimization in an autoregressive fashion which directly generates the execution plan without explicit plan enumeration. To investigate the essential input of LLM-QO, we design a customized data recipe named QInstruct to collect the training data from various optimizers and serialize the database's meta data, queries and corresponding plans into a textual format. Based on QInstruct, we implement a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline, Query Instruction Tuning (QIT) and Query Direct Preference Optimization (QDPO), to empower the capability of general-purpose LLMs in handling query optimization. In our experiments, LLM-QO can generate valid and high-quality plans and consistently outperforms both traditional and learned optimizers on three query workloads. Our findings verify that LLMs can be derived as query optimizers where generalization, efficiency and adaptivity deserve further research efforts.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Traditionally, students relied heavily on web search for coding assistance, but this has shifted with the adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT. However, the comparative process and outcomes of using web search versus LLMs for coding help remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted a randomized interview study in a database classroom to compare web search and LLMs, including a publicly available LLM (ChatGPT) and an instructor-tuned LLM, for writing SQL queries. Our findings indicate that using an instructor-tuned LLM required significantly more interactions than both ChatGPT and web search, but resulted in a similar number of edits to the final SQL query. No significant differences were found in the quality of the final SQL queries between conditions, although the LLM conditions directionally showed higher query quality. Furthermore, students using instructor-tuned LLM reported a lower mental demand. These results have implications for learning and productivity in programming education.</p></details> |  |

We design, implement, and evaluate TASM, a new tile-based storage manager for video data. TASM uses a feature in modern video codecs called "tiles" that enables spatial random access into encoded videos. TASM physically tunes stored videos by optimizing their tile layouts given the video content and a query workload. Additionally, TASM dynamically tunes that layout in response to changes in the query workload or if the query workload and video contents are incrementally discovered. Finally, TASM also produces efficient initial tile layouts for newly ingested videos. We demonstrate that TASM can speed up subframe selection queries by an average of over 50% and up to 94%. TASM can also improve the throughput of the full scan phase of object detection queries by up to 2X.</p></details> |  |

We complete a user query prefix conditioned upon an image. Given the complete query, we fine tune a BERT embedding for estimating probabilities of a broad set of instances. The resulting instance probabilities are used for selection while being agnostic to the segmentation or attention mechanism. Our results demonstrate that auto-completion using both language and vision performs better than using only language, and that fine tuning a BERT embedding allows to efficiently rank instances in the image.

Existing methods that directly inject queries into model layers by modifying the network architecture often struggle to adapt to new datasets with limited annotations. To address this, we introduce QID, a novel, streamlined, architecture-preserving approach that integrates query embeddings into the vision encoder, leading to notable performance gains, particularly in data-scarce fine-tuning scenarios. Specifically, our approach introduces a dual-module framework: a query-aware module that generates a unique query vector to precisely guide the model's focus, as well as a query-agnostic module that captures the positional relationships among tokens, ensuring robust spatial understanding. Notably, both modules operate independently of the vision attention blocks, facilitating targeted learning of query embeddings and enhancing visual semantic identification. Experiments with OCR-free VLMs across multiple datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements using our method, especially in handling text-rich documents in data-scarce environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by CVPR 2025 MULA</p></details> |

Especially ranking ensembles based on different topically related queries retrieve better results than rankings based on a single query alone. Recently, generative instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) improved on a variety of different tasks in capturing human language. To this end, this work explores the feasibility of using synthetic query variants generated by instruction-tuned LLMs in data fusion experiments. More specifically, we introduce a lightweight, unsupervised, and cost-efficient approach that exploits principled prompting and data fusion techniques. In our experiments, LLMs produce more effective queries when provided with additional context information on the topic. Furthermore, our analysis based on four TREC newswire benchmarks shows that data fusion based on synthetic query variants is significantly better than baselines with single queries and also outperforms pseudo-relevance feedback methods.

One of the challenges in DR is the lack of domain-specific training data. While DR models can learn from large-scale public datasets like MS MARCO through transfer learning, evidence shows that not all DR models and domains can benefit from transfer learning equally. Recently, some researchers have resorted to large language models (LLMs) to improve the zero-shot and few-shot DR models. However, the hard prompts or human-written prompts utilized in these works cannot guarantee the good quality of generated weak queries. To tackle this, we propose soft prompt tuning for augmenting DR (SPTAR): For each task, we leverage soft prompt-tuning to optimize a task-specific soft prompt on limited ground truth data and then prompt the LLMs to tag unlabeled documents with weak queries, yielding enough weak document-query pairs to train task-specific dense retrievers. We design a filter to select high-quality example document-query pairs in the prompt to further improve the quality of weak tagged queries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work utilizing soft prompt tuning to augment DR models. The experiments demonstrate that SPTAR outperforms the unsupervised baselines BM25 and the recently proposed LLMs-based augmentation method for DR.</p></details> | Under Reivew |

Meanwhile, the manual construction of a query-focused summarization corpus is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we use Wikipedia to automatically collect a large query-focused summarization dataset (named WIKIREF) of more than 280, 000 examples, which can serve as a means of data augmentation. We also develop a BERT-based query-focused summarization model (Q-BERT) to extract sentences from the documents as summaries. To better adapt a huge model containing millions of parameters to tiny benchmarks, we identify and fine-tune only a sparse subnetwork, which corresponds to a small fraction of the whole model parameters. Experimental results on three DUC benchmarks show that the model pre-trained on WIKIREF has already achieved reasonable performance. After fine-tuning on the specific benchmark datasets, the model with data augmentation outperforms strong comparison systems. Moreover, both our proposed Q-BERT model and subnetwork fine-tuning further improve the model performance. The dataset is publicly available at https://aka.ms/wikiref.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (TASLP)</p></details> |

This paper focus on this task of extracting relevant paragraphs from legal judgements based on the query. We construct a specialized dataset for this task from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) using the case law guides. We assess the performance of current retrieval models in a zero-shot way and also establish fine-tuning benchmarks using various models. The results highlight the significant gap between fine-tuned and zero-shot performance, emphasizing the challenge of handling distribution shift in the legal domain. We notice that the legal pre-training handles distribution shift on the corpus side but still struggles on query side distribution shift, with unseen legal queries. We also explore various Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to evaluate their practicality within the context of information retrieval, shedding light on the effectiveness of different PEFT methods across diverse configurations with pre-training and model architectures influencing the choice of PEFT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |
| **[Context Aware Query Rewriting for Text Rankers using LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16753v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query rewriting refers to an established family of approaches that are applied to underspecified and ambiguous queries to overcome the vocabulary mismatch problem in document ranking. Queries are typically rewritten during query processing time for better query modelling for the downstream ranker. With the advent of large-language models (LLMs), there have been initial investigations into using generative approaches to generate pseudo documents to tackle this inherent vocabulary gap. In this work, we analyze the utility of LLMs for improved query rewriting for text ranking tasks. We find that there are two inherent limitations of using LLMs as query re-writers -- concept drift when using only queries as prompts and large inference costs during query processing. We adopt a simple, yet surprisingly effective, approach called context aware query rewriting (CAR) to leverage the benefits of LLMs for query understanding. Firstly, we rewrite ambiguous training queries by context-aware prompting of LLMs, where we use only relevant documents as context.Unlike existing approaches, we use LLM-based query rewriting only during the training phase. Eventually, a ranker is fine-tuned on the rewritten queries instead of the original queries during training. In our extensive experiments, we find that fine-tuning a ranker using re-written queries offers a significant improvement of up to 33% on the passage ranking task and up to 28% on the document ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of using original queries.</p></details> |  |

In application scenarios, users intend to express their retrieval intent through various query styles. However, current retrieval tasks predominantly focus on text-query retrieval exploration, leading to limited retrieval query options and potential ambiguity or bias in user intention. In this paper, we propose the Style-Diversified Query-Based Image Retrieval task, which enables retrieval based on various query styles. To facilitate the novel setting, we propose the first Diverse-Style Retrieval dataset, encompassing diverse query styles including text, sketch, low-resolution, and art. We also propose a light-weighted style-diversified retrieval framework. For various query style inputs, we apply the Gram Matrix to extract the query's textural features and cluster them into a style space with style-specific bases. Then we employ the style-init prompt tuning module to enable the visual encoder to comprehend the texture and style information of the query. Experiments demonstrate that our model, employing the style-init prompt tuning strategy, outperforms existing retrieval models on the style-diversified retrieval task. Moreover, style-diversified queries~(sketch+text, art+text, etc) can be simultaneously retrieved in our model. The auxiliary information from other queries enhances the retrieval performance within the respective query.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Typos-aware Bottlenecked Pre-Training for Robust Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08138v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current dense retrievers (DRs) are limited in their ability to effectively process misspelled queries, which constitute a significant portion of query traffic in commercial search engines. The main issue is that the pre-trained language model-based encoders used by DRs are typically trained and fine-tuned using clean, well-curated text data. Misspelled queries are typically not found in the data used for training these models, and thus misspelled queries observed at inference time are out-of-distribution compared to the data used for training and fine-tuning. Previous efforts to address this issue have focused on \textit{fine-tuning} strategies, but their effectiveness on misspelled queries remains lower than that of pipelines that employ separate state-of-the-art spell-checking components. To address this challenge, we propose ToRoDer (TypOs-aware bottlenecked pre-training for RObust DEnse Retrieval), a novel re-training strategy for DRs that increases their robustness to misspelled queries while preserving their effectiveness in downstream retrieval tasks. ToRoDer utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder takes misspelled text with masked tokens as input and outputs bottlenecked information to the decoder. The decoder then takes as input the bottlenecked embeddings, along with token embeddings of the original text with the misspelled tokens masked out. The pre-training task is to recover the masked tokens for both the encoder and decoder. Our extensive experimental results and detailed ablation studies show that DRs pre-trained with ToRoDer exhibit significantly higher effectiveness on misspelled queries, sensibly closing the gap with pipelines that use a separate, complex spell-checker component, while retaining their effectiveness on correctly spelled queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, accepted at SIGIR-AP</p></details> |

In principle, fine-tuning these models for specialized retrieval tasks should yield higher effectiveness than relying on a one-size-fits-all model, but in practice, results can disappoint. We show that standard fine-tuning methods using an InfoNCE loss can unexpectedly degrade effectiveness rather than improve it, even for domain-specific scenarios. This holds true even when applying widely adopted techniques such as hard-negative mining and negative de-noising. To address this, we explore a training strategy that uses listwise distillation from a teacher cross-encoder, leveraging rich relevance signals to fine-tune the retriever. We further explore synthetic query generation using large language models. Through listwise distillation and training with a diverse set of queries ranging from natural user searches and factual claims to keyword-based queries, we achieve consistent effectiveness gains across multiple datasets. Our results also reveal that synthetic queries can rival human-written queries in training utility. However, we also identify limitations, particularly in the effectiveness of cross-encoder teachers as a bottleneck. We release our code and scripts to encourage further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Style Breaks Safety: Defending LLMs Against Superficial Style Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07452v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g., formatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation correlates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

Employing the popular Text-to-SQL dataset, spider, the goal was to input a natural language question along with the database schema and output the correct SQL SELECT query. The initial approach was to fine-tune a local and open-source model to generate the SELECT query. After QLoRa fine-tuning WizardLM's WizardCoder-15B model on the spider dataset, the execution accuracy for generated queries rose to a high of 61%. With the second approach, using the fine-tuned gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (Few-shot) + gpt-4-turbo (Zero-shot error correction), the execution accuracy reached a high of 82.1%. Of all the incorrect queries, most can be categorized into a seven different categories of what went wrong: selecting the wrong columns or wrong order of columns, grouping by the wrong column, predicting the wrong values in conditionals, using different aggregates than the ground truth, extra or too few JOIN clauses, inconsistencies in the Spider dataset, and lastly completely incorrect query structure. Most if not all of the queries fall into these categories and it is insightful to understanding where the faults still lie with LLM program synthesis and where they can be improved.</p></details> |  |

Recent research present learned query optimizations results mostly in bulks of single workloads which focus on picking up the unique traits of the specific workload. This proves to be problematic in scenarios where the different characteristics of multiple workloads and datasets are to be mixed and learned together. Henceforth, in this paper, we propose BitE, a novel ensemble learning model using database statistics and metadata to tune a learned query optimizer for enhancing performance. On the way, we introduce multiple revisions to solve several challenges: we extend the search space for the optimal Abstract SQL Plan(represented as a JSON object called ASP) by expanding hintsets, we steer the model away from the default plans that may be biased by configuring the experience with all unique plans of queries, and we deviate from the traditional loss functions and choose an alternative method to cope with underestimation and overestimation of reward. Our model achieves 19.6% more improved queries and 15.8% less regressed queries compared to the existing traditional methods whilst using a comparable level of resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was done when the first three author were interns in SAP Labs Korea and they have equal contribution</p></details> |

It aims to generate a concise highlight for a given query. Different from text summarization, query-focused summarization has long been plagued by the problem of lacking high-quality large-scale datasets. In this paper, we investigate the idea that whether we can integrate and transfer the knowledge of text summarization and question answering to assist the few-shot learning in query-focused summarization. Here, we propose prefix-merging, a prefix-based pretraining strategy for few-shot learning in query-focused summarization. Drawn inspiration from prefix-tuning, we are allowed to integrate the task knowledge from text summarization and question answering into a properly designed prefix and apply the merged prefix to query-focused summarization. With only a small amount of trainable parameters, prefix-merging outperforms fine-tuning on query-focused summarization. We further discuss the influence of different prefix designs and propose a visualized explanation for how prefix-merging works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2022</p></details> |

Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the best balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance heavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are difficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users often prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal PG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies have explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by inefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to construct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the dataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies between configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives. To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for automatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model transfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query performance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs. It also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration recommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific datasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates out-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in dynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across different datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to 14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios. The code and data for PGTuner are available online at https://github.com/hao-duan/PGTuner.</p></details> |  |

SetBERT significantly improves retrieval performance for logic-structured queries, an area where both traditional and neural retrieval methods typically underperform. We propose an innovative use of inversed-contrastive loss, focusing on identifying the negative sentence, and fine-tuning BERT with a dataset generated via prompt GPT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, unlike other BERT-based models, fine-tuning with triplet loss actually degrades performance for this specific task. Our experiments reveal that SetBERT-base not only significantly outperforms BERT-base (up to a 63% improvement in Recall) but also achieves performance comparable to the much larger BERT-large model, despite being only one-third the size.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Techniques to accelerate the execution of filter expressions include clustered indexes, specialized sort orders (e.g., Z-order), multi-dimensional indexes, and, for high selectivity queries, secondary indexes. However, these schemes are hard to tune and their performance is inconsistent. Recent work on learned multi-dimensional indexes has introduced the idea of automatically optimizing an index for a particular dataset and workload. However, the performance of that work suffers in the presence of correlated data and skewed query workloads, both of which are common in real applications. In this paper, we introduce Tsunami, which addresses these limitations to achieve up to 6X faster query performance and up to 8X smaller index size than existing learned multi-dimensional indexes, in addition to up to 11X faster query performance and 170X smaller index size than optimally-tuned traditional indexes.</p></details> |  |

For optimal performance, these parameters must be tuned to the specific job being run. Tuning commonly requires multiple executions to collect runtime information for updating parameters. This is infeasible for ad hoc queries that are run once or infrequently. Zero-execution tuning, where parameters are automatically set before a job's first run, can provide significant savings for all types of applications, but is more challenging since runtime information is not available. In this work, we propose a novel method for zero-execution tuning of Spark configurations based on retrieval. Our method achieves 93.3% of the runtime improvement of state-of-the-art one-execution optimization, entirely avoiding the slow initial execution using default settings. The shift to zero-execution tuning results in a lower cumulative runtime over the first 140 runs, and provides the largest benefit for ad hoc and analytical queries which only need to be executed once. We release the largest and most comprehensive suite of Spark query datasets, optimal configurations, and runtime information, which will promote future development of zero-execution tuning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and datasets available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/spark-retrieval-tuning</p></details> |

Previous works usually synthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed by instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of these datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent failures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries. Hypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learn complex reasoning, we propose Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART), a method that allocates difficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more extensive training on difficult samples. Utilizing DART, we have created new datasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries and are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis process solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the commonly used proprietary GPT-4. We fine-tune various base models on our datasets ranging from 7B to 70B in size, resulting in a series of strong models called DART-MATH. In comprehensive in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on 6 mathematical benchmarks, DART-MATH outperforms vanilla rejection tuning significantly, being superior or comparable to previous arts, despite using much smaller datasets and no proprietary models. Furthermore, our results position our synthetic datasets as the most effective and cost-efficient publicly available resources for advancing mathematical problem-solving.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for LLMs</p></details> |
| **[HyQE: Ranking Contexts with Hypothetical Query Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15262v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In retrieval-augmented systems, context ranking techniques are commonly employed to reorder the retrieved contexts based on their relevance to a user query. A standard approach is to measure this relevance through the similarity between contexts and queries in the embedding space. However, such similarity often fails to capture the relevance. Alternatively, large language models (LLMs) have been used for ranking contexts. However, they can encounter scalability issues when the number of candidate contexts grows and the context window sizes of the LLMs remain constrained. Additionally, these approaches require fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data. In this work, we introduce a scalable ranking framework that combines embedding similarity and LLM capabilities without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our framework uses a pre-trained LLM to hypothesize the user query based on the retrieved contexts and ranks the context based on the similarity between the hypothesized queries and the user query. Our framework is efficient at inference time and is compatible with many other retrieval and ranking techniques. Experimental results show that our method improves the ranking performance across multiple benchmarks. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/zwc662/hyqe</p></details> |  |
| **[Rank-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in LLM-based Document Rerankers via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06034v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce Rank-R1, a novel LLM-based reranker that performs reasoning over both the user query and candidate documents before performing the ranking task. Existing document reranking methods based on large language models (LLMs) typically rely on prompting or fine-tuning LLMs to order or label candidate documents according to their relevance to a query. For Rank-R1, we use a reinforcement learning algorithm along with only a small set of relevance labels (without any reasoning supervision) to enhance the reasoning ability of LLM-based rerankers. Our hypothesis is that adding reasoning capabilities to the rerankers can improve their relevance assessement and ranking capabilities. Our experiments on the TREC DL and BRIGHT datasets show that Rank-R1 is highly effective, especially for complex queries. In particular, we find that Rank-R1 achieves effectiveness on in-domain datasets at par with that of supervised fine-tuning methods, but utilizing only 18\% of the training data used by the fine-tuning methods. We also find that the model largely outperforms zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning when applied to out-of-domain datasets featuring complex queries, especially when a 14B-size model is used. Finally, we qualitatively observe that Rank-R1's reasoning process improves the explainability of the ranking results, opening new opportunities for search engine results presentation and fruition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Data Structures for Analytical Query Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13099v1)** | 2021-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for automatically choosing data structures to support efficient computation of analytical workloads. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a novel low-level intermediate language that can express the algorithms behind various query processing paradigms such as classical joins, groupjoin, and in-database machine learning engines. This language is designed around the notion of dictionaries, and allows for a more fine-grained choice of its low-level implementation. Second, the cost model for alternative implementations is automatically inferred by combining machine learning and program reasoning. The dictionary cost model is learned using a regression model trained over the profiling dataset of dictionary operations on a given hardware architecture. The program cost model is inferred using static program analysis. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the trained cost model on micro benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that the performance of the code generated by our framework either outperforms or is on par with the state-of-the-art analytical query engines and a recent in-database machine learning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Hands-Free Query Optimizer through Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10212v2)** | 2018-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query optimization remains one of the most important and well-studied problems in database systems. However, traditional query optimizers are complex heuristically-driven systems, requiring large amounts of time to tune for a particular database and requiring even more time to develop and maintain in the first place. In this vision paper, we argue that a new type of query optimizer, based on deep reinforcement learning, can drastically improve on the state-of-the-art. We identify potential complications for future research that integrates deep learning with query optimization, and we describe three novel deep learning based approaches that can lead the way to end-to-end learning-based query optimizers.</p></details> | Published in CIDR19 |
| **[Leveraging LLMs to Enable Natural Language Search on Go-to-market Platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05048v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise searches require users to have complex knowledge of queries, configurations, and metadata, rendering it difficult for them to access information as needed. Most go-to-market (GTM) platforms utilize advanced search, an interface that enables users to filter queries by various fields using categories or keywords, which, historically, however, has proven to be exceedingly cumbersome, as users are faced with seemingly hundreds of options, fields, and buttons. Consequently, querying with natural language has long been ideal, a notion further empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we implement and evaluate a solution for the Zoominfo product for sellers, which prompts the LLM with natural language, producing search fields through entity extraction that are then converted into a search query. The intermediary search fields offer numerous advantages for each query, including the elimination of syntax errors, simpler ground truths, and an intuitive format for the LLM to interpret. We paired this pipeline with many advanced prompt engineering strategies, featuring an intricate system message, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and execution refinement. Furthermore, we manually created the ground truth for 500+ natural language queries, enabling the supervised fine-tuning of Llama-3-8B-Instruct and the introduction of sophisticated numerical metrics. Comprehensive experiments with closed, open source, and fine-tuned LLM models were conducted through exact, Jaccard, cosine, and semantic similarity on individual search entities to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Overall, the most accurate closed model had an average accuracy of 97% per query, with only one field performing under 90%, with comparable results observed from the fine-tuned models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Esc: An Early-stopping Checker for Budget-aware Index Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02876v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Index tuning is a time-consuming process. One major performance bottleneck in existing index tuning systems is the large amount of "what-if" query optimizer calls that estimate the cost of a given pair of query and index configuration without materializing the indexes. There has been recent work on budget-aware index tuning that limits the amount of what-if calls allowed in index tuning. Existing budget-aware index tuning algorithms, however, typically make fast progress early on in terms of the best configuration found but slow down when more and more what-if calls are allocated. This observation of "diminishing return" on index quality leads us to introduce early stopping for budget-aware index tuning, where user specifies a threshold on the tolerable loss of index quality and we stop index tuning if the projected loss with the remaining budget is below the threshold. We further propose Esc, a low-overhead early-stopping checker that realizes this new functionality. Experimental evaluation on top of both industrial benchmarks and real customer workloads demonstrate that Esc can significantly reduce the number of what-if calls made during budget-aware index tuning while incur little or zero improvement loss and little extra computational overhead compared to the overall index tuning time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of a paper published at VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fast and exact fixed-radius neighbor search based on sorting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07679v6)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixed-radius near neighbor search is a fundamental data operation that retrieves all data points within a user-specified distance to a query point. There are efficient algorithms that can provide fast approximate query responses, but they often have a very compute-intensive indexing phase and require careful parameter tuning. Therefore, exact brute force and tree-based search methods are still widely used. Here we propose a new fixed-radius near neighbor search method, called SNN, that significantly improves over brute force and tree-based methods in terms of index and query time, provably returns exact results, and requires no parameter tuning. SNN exploits a sorting of the data points by their first principal component to prune the query search space. Further speedup is gained from an efficient implementation using high-level Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We provide theoretical analysis of our method and demonstrate its practical performance when used stand-alone and when applied within the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2202.01456</p></details> |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vernacular Search Query Translation with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03711v1)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the democratization of e-commerce platforms, an increasingly diversified user base is opting to shop online. To provide a comfortable and reliable shopping experience, it's important to enable users to interact with the platform in the language of their choice. An accurate query translation is essential for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) with vernacular queries. Due to internet-scale operations, e-commerce platforms get millions of search queries every day. However, creating a parallel training set to train an in-domain translation model is cumbersome. This paper proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation approach to translate search queries without using any parallel corpus. We use an open-domain translation model (trained on public corpus) and adapt it to the query data using only the monolingual queries from two languages. In addition, fine-tuning with a small labeled set further improves the result. For demonstration, we show results for Hindi to English query translation and use mBART-large-50 model as the baseline to improve upon. Experimental results show that, without using any parallel corpus, we obtain more than 20 BLEU points improvement over the baseline while fine-tuning with a small 50k labeled set provides more than 27 BLEU points improvement over the baseline.</p></details> |  |

Models are trained on a large amount of text, yet their responses need to be limited to a desired scope and style of a dialog agent. Because the datasets used to achieve the former contain language that is not compatible with the latter, pre-trained dialog models are fine-tuned on smaller curated datasets. However, the fine-tuning process robs them of the ability to produce diverse responses, eventually reducing them to dull conversation partners. In this paper we investigate if prompting can mitigate the above trade-off. Specifically, we experiment with conditioning the prompt on the query, rather than training a single prompt for all queries. By following the intuition that freezing the pre-trained language model will conserve its expressivity, we find that compared to fine-tuning, prompting can achieve a higher BLEU score and substantially improve the diversity and novelty of the responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Photo Finishing Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07300v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo finishing tuning aims to automate the manual tuning process of the photo finishing pipeline, like Adobe Lightroom or Darktable. Previous works either use zeroth-order optimization, which is slow when the set of parameters increases, or rely on a differentiable proxy of the target finishing pipeline, which is hard to train. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework for efficiently tuning parameters using a goal image as a condition. Unlike previous approaches, our tuning framework does not rely on any proxy and treats the photo finishing pipeline as a black box. Utilizing a trained reinforcement learning policy, it can efficiently find the desired set of parameters within just 10 queries, while optimization based approaches normally take 200 queries. Furthermore, our architecture utilizes a goal image to guide the iterative tuning of pipeline parameters, allowing for flexible conditioning on pixel-aligned target images, style images, or any other visually representable goals. We conduct detailed experiments on photo finishing tuning and photo stylization tuning tasks, demonstrating the advantages of our method.

A query is strongly dependent on the conversation context. An effective way to improve retrieval effectiveness is to expand the current query with historical queries. However, not all the previous queries are related to, and useful for expanding the current query. In this paper, we propose a new method to select relevant historical queries that are useful for the current query. To cope with the lack of labeled training data, we use a pseudo-labeling approach to annotate useful historical queries based on their impact on the retrieval results. The pseudo-labeled data are used to train a selection model. We further propose a multi-task learning framework to jointly train the selector and the retriever during fine-tuning, allowing us to mitigate the possible inconsistency between the pseudo labels and the changed retriever. Extensive experiments on four conversational search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our method compared with several strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2023 Research Track</p></details> |

However, such datasets are often unavailable, and their utility for real-world applications can diminish quickly due to domain shifts. To address this challenge, we develop and motivate a method for using large language models (LLMs) to generate large numbers of synthetic queries cheaply. The method begins by generating a small number of synthetic queries using an expensive LLM. After that, a much less expensive one is used to create large numbers of synthetic queries, which are used to fine-tune a family of reranker models. These rerankers are then distilled into a single efficient retriever for use in the target domain. We show that this technique boosts zero-shot accuracy in long-tail domains and achieves substantially lower latency than standard reranking methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Long ...</summary><p>Long Paper at Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2023</p></details> |

In this work we improve the retrieval effectiveness of the BERT re-ranker, proposing an extension to its fine-tuning step to better exploit the context of queries. To this end, we use an additional document-level representation learning objective besides the ranking objective when fine-tuning the BERT re-ranker. Our experiments on two QBD retrieval benchmarks show that the proposed multi-task optimization significantly improves the ranking effectiveness without changing the BERT re-ranker or using additional training samples. In future work, the generalizability of our approach to other retrieval tasks should be further investigated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 44th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR2022)</p></details> |
| **[Multipoint-BAX: A New Approach for Efficiently Tuning Particle Accelerator Emittance via Virtual Objectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04587v5)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although beam emittance is critical for the performance of high-brightness accelerators, optimization is often time limited as emittance calculations, commonly done via quadrupole scans, are typically slow. Such calculations are a type of $\textit{multipoint query}$, i.e. each query requires multiple secondary measurements. Traditional black-box optimizers such as Bayesian optimization are slow and inefficient when dealing with such objectives as they must acquire the full series of measurements, but return only the emittance, with each query. We propose a new information-theoretic algorithm, Multipoint-BAX, for black-box optimization on multipoint queries, which queries and models individual beam-size measurements using techniques from Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX). Our method avoids the slow multipoint query on the accelerator by acquiring points through a $\textit{virtual objective}$, i.e. calculating the emittance objective from a fast learned model rather than directly from the accelerator. We use Multipoint-BAX to minimize emittance at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests II (FACET-II). In simulation, our method is 20$\times$ faster and more robust to noise compared to existing methods. In live tests, it matched the hand-tuned emittance at FACET-II and achieved a 24% lower emittance than hand-tuning at LCLS. Our method represents a conceptual shift for optimizing multipoint queries, and we anticipate that it can be readily adapted to similar problems in particle accelerators and other scientific instruments.</p></details> |  |

Existing VMR methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. Although some recent studies introduce a zero-shot setting to avoid fine-tuning, they overlook inherent language bias in the query, leading to erroneous localization. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes Moment-GPT, a tuning-free pipeline for zero-shot VMR utilizing frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we first employ LLaMA-3 to correct and rephrase the query to mitigate language bias. Subsequently, we design a span generator combined with MiniGPT-v2 to produce candidate spans adaptively. Finally, to leverage the video comprehension capabilities of MLLMs, we apply VideoChatGPT and span scorer to select the most appropriate spans. Our proposed method substantially outperforms the state-ofthe-art MLLM-based and zero-shot models on several public datasets, including QVHighlights, ActivityNet-Captions, and Charades-STA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Different from the traditional single-turn ad-hoc search, conversational search encounters a more challenging problem of context-dependent query understanding with the lengthy and long-tail conversational history context. While conversational query rewriting methods leverage explicit rewritten queries to train a rewriting model to transform the context-dependent query into a stand-stone search query, this is usually done without considering the quality of search results. Conversational dense retrieval methods use fine-tuning to improve a pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder, but they are limited by the conversational search data available for training. In this paper, we leverage both rewritten queries and relevance judgments in the conversational search data to train a better query representation model. The key idea is to align the query representation with those of rewritten queries and relevant documents. The proposed model -- Query Representation Alignment Conversational Dense Retriever, QRACDR, is tested on eight datasets, including various settings in conversational search and ad-hoc search. The results demonstrate the strong performance of QRACDR compared with state-of-the-art methods, and confirm the effectiveness of representation alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

All these methods suffer from the requirement that the query distribution must be known in advance. We present a new data structure for point location queries in planar triangulations. Our structure is asymptotically as fast as the optimal structures, but it requires no prior information about the queries. This is a 2D analogue of the jump from Knuth's optimum binary search trees (discovered in 1971) to the splay trees of Sleator and Tarjan in 1985. While the former need to know the query distribution, the latter are statically optimal. This means that we can adapt to the query sequence and achieve the same asymptotic performance as an optimum static structure, without needing any additional information.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, a preliminary version appeared at SoCG 2011</p></details> |
| **[RevSAM2: Prompt SAM2 for Medical Image Segmentation via Reverse-Propagation without Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04298v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has recently demonstrated exceptional performance in zero-shot prompt segmentation for natural images and videos. However, when the propagation mechanism of SAM2 is applied to medical images, it often results in spatial inconsistencies, leading to significantly different segmentation outcomes for very similar images. In this paper, we introduce RevSAM2, a simple yet effective self-correction framework that enables SAM2 to achieve superior performance in unseen 3D medical image segmentation tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, to segment a 3D query volume using a limited number of support image-label pairs that define a new segmentation task, we propose reverse propagation strategy as a query information selection mechanism. Instead of simply maintaining a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of memories to predict query slices sequentially, reverse propagation selects high-quality query information by leveraging support images to evaluate the quality of each predicted query slice mask. The selected high-quality masks are then used as prompts to propagate across the entire query volume, thereby enhancing generalization to unseen tasks. Notably, we are the first to explore the potential of SAM2 in label-efficient medical image segmentation without fine-tuning. Compared to fine-tuning on large labeled datasets, the label-efficient scenario provides a cost-effective alternative for medical segmentation tasks, particularly for rare diseases or when dealing with unseen classes. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RevSAM2 in scenarios with limited labels, surpassing state-of-the-arts by 12.18% in Dice. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4Hint: Leveraging Large Language Models for Hint Recommendation in Offline Query Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03384v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS, and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers. Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical features. In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint} that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in terms of both effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLOPS: Forward Learning with OPtimal Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05966v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the limitations of backpropagation, perturbation-based gradient computation methods have recently gained focus for learning with only forward passes, also referred to as queries. Conventional forward learning consumes enormous queries on each data point for accurate gradient estimation through Monte Carlo sampling, which hinders the scalability of those algorithms. However, not all data points deserve equal queries for gradient estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of improving the forward learning efficiency from a novel perspective: how to reduce the gradient estimation variance with minimum cost? For this, we propose to allocate the optimal number of queries over each data in one batch during training to achieve a good balance between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, with a simplified proxy objective and a reparameterization technique, we derive a novel plug-and-play query allocator with minimal parameters. Theoretical results are carried out to verify its optimality. We conduct extensive experiments for fine-tuning Vision Transformers on various datasets and further deploy the allocator to two black-box applications: prompt tuning and multimodal alignment for foundation models. All findings demonstrate that our proposed allocator significantly enhances the scalability of forward-learning algorithms, paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations(ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

In practice, users often pose multiple questions in a single conversation with LLMs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Group Query Attack, a technique that simulates this scenario by presenting groups of queries to LLMs simultaneously. We investigate how the accumulated context from consecutive prompts influences the outputs of LLMs. Specifically, we observe that Group Query Attack significantly degrades the performance of models fine-tuned on specific tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Group Query Attack induces a risk of triggering potential backdoors of LLMs. Besides, Group Query Attack is also effective in tasks involving reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation for pre-trained and aligned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention to the Burstiness in Visual Prompt Tuning!](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22908v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; v2: camera ready</p></details> |
| **[Episode-specific Fine-tuning for Metric-based Few-shot Learners with Optimization-based Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17499v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning (RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and generalizes well across different audio domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[QCQA: Quality and Capacity-aware grouped Query Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10247v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Excessive memory requirements of key and value features (KV-cache) present significant challenges in the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs), restricting both the speed and length of text generation. Approaches such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped Query Attention (GQA) mitigate these challenges by grouping query heads and consequently reducing the number of corresponding key and value heads. However, MQA and GQA decrease the KV-cache size requirements at the expense of LLM accuracy (quality of text generation). These methods do not ensure an optimal tradeoff between KV-cache size and text generation quality due to the absence of quality-aware grouping of query heads. To address this issue, we propose Quality and Capacity-Aware Grouped Query Attention (QCQA), which identifies optimal query head groupings using an evolutionary algorithm with a computationally efficient and inexpensive fitness function. We demonstrate that QCQA achieves a significantly better tradeoff between KV-cache capacity and LLM accuracy compared to GQA. For the Llama2 $7\,$B model, QCQA achieves $\mathbf{20}$\% higher accuracy than GQA with similar KV-cache size requirements in the absence of fine-tuning. After fine-tuning both QCQA and GQA, for a similar KV-cache size, QCQA provides $\mathbf{10.55}\,$\% higher accuracy than GQA. Furthermore, QCQA requires $40\,$\% less KV-cache size than GQA to attain similar accuracy. The proposed quality and capacity-aware grouping of query heads can serve as a new paradigm for KV-cache optimization in autoregressive LLM inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Surprising Effectiveness of Rankers Trained on Expanded Queries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02587v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important problem in text-ranking systems is handling the hard queries that form the tail end of the query distribution. The difficulty may arise due to the presence of uncommon, underspecified, or incomplete queries. In this work, we improve the ranking performance of hard or difficult queries without compromising the performance of other queries. Firstly, we do LLM based query enrichment for training queries using relevant documents. Next, a specialized ranker is fine-tuned only on the enriched hard queries instead of the original queries. We combine the relevance scores from the specialized ranker and the base ranker, along with a query performance score estimated for each query. Our approach departs from existing methods that usually employ a single ranker for all queries, which is biased towards easy queries, which form the majority of the query distribution. In our extensive experiments on the DL-Hard dataset, we find that a principled query performance based scoring method using base and specialized ranker offers a significant improvement of up to 25% on the passage ranking task and up to 48.4% on the document ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of using original queries, even outperforming SOTA model.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interactive Query Generation Assistant using LLM-based Prompt Modification and User Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11226v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While search is the predominant method of accessing information, formulating effective queries remains a challenging task, especially for situations where the users are not familiar with a domain, or searching for documents in other languages, or looking for complex information such as events, which are not easily expressible as queries. Providing example documents or passages of interest, might be easier for a user, however, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to concept drift, and are highly sensitive to the query generation method. This demo illustrates complementary approaches of using LLMs interactively, assisting and enabling the user to provide edits and feedback at all stages of the query formulation process. The proposed Query Generation Assistant is a novel search interface which supports automatic and interactive query generation over a mono-linguial or multi-lingual document collection. Specifically, the proposed assistive interface enables the users to refine the queries generated by different LLMs, to provide feedback on the retrieved documents or passages, and is able to incorporate the users' feedback as prompts to generate more effective queries. The proposed interface is a valuable experimental tool for exploring fine-tuning and prompting of LLMs for query generation to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval and ranking models, and for conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiments for complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries without such assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Intel...</summary><p>Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) BETTER Research Program</p></details> |
| **[CoAPT: Context Attribute words for Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13808v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel prompt tuning method called CoAPT(Context Attribute words in Prompt Tuning) for few/zero-shot image classification. The core motivation is that attributes are descriptive words with rich information about a given concept. Thus, we aim to enrich text queries of existing prompt tuning methods, improving alignment between text and image embeddings in CLIP embedding space. To do so, CoAPT integrates attribute words as additional prompts within learnable prompt tuning and can be easily incorporated into various existing prompt tuning methods. To facilitate the incorporation of attributes into text embeddings and the alignment with image embeddings, soft prompts are trained together with an additional meta-network that generates input-image-wise feature biases from the concatenated feature encodings of the image-text combined queries. Our experiments demonstrate that CoAPT leads to considerable improvements for existing baseline methods on several few/zero-shot image classification tasks, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Our findings highlight the importance of combining hard and soft prompts and pave the way for future research on the interplay between text and image latent spaces in pre-trained models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Our dataset was arabized and localized from the original English Banking77 dataset, which consists of 13,083 queries to ArBanking77 dataset with 31,404 queries in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Palestinian dialect, with each query classified into one of the 77 classes (intents). Furthermore, we present a neural model, based on AraBERT, fine-tuned on ArBanking77, which achieved an F1-score of 0.9209 and 0.8995 on MSA and Palestinian dialect, respectively. We performed extensive experimentation in which we simulated low-resource settings, where the model is trained on a subset of the data and augmented with noisy queries to simulate colloquial terms, mistakes and misspellings found in real NLP systems, especially live chat queries.

| **[An Analytical Study of Large SPARQL Query Logs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00363v1)** | 2017-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the adoption of RDF as the data model for Linked Data and the Semantic Web, query specification from end- users has become more and more common in SPARQL end- points. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analytical study of the queries formulated by end-users and harvested from large and up-to-date query logs from a wide variety of RDF data sources. As opposed to previous studies, ours is the first assessment on a voluminous query corpus, span- ning over several years and covering many representative SPARQL endpoints. Apart from the syntactical structure of the queries, that exhibits already interesting results on this generalized corpus, we drill deeper in the structural char- acteristics related to the graph- and hypergraph represen- tation of queries. We outline the most common shapes of queries when visually displayed as pseudographs, and char- acterize their (hyper-)tree width. Moreover, we analyze the evolution of queries over time, by introducing the novel con- cept of a streak, i.e., a sequence of queries that appear as subsequent modifications of a seed query. Our study offers several fresh insights on the already rich query features of real SPARQL queries formulated by real users, and brings us to draw a number of conclusions and pinpoint future di- rections for SPARQL query evaluation, query optimization, tuning, and benchmarking.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this challenge, in this study, we evaluate several strategies for fine-tuning the OpenLlama LLM for question answering over life science knowledge graphs. In particular, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation approach for extending a set of existing queries over a given knowledge graph towards a larger dataset of semantically enriched question-to-SPARQL query pairs, enabling fine-tuning even for datasets where these pairs are scarce. In this context, we also investigate the role of semantic "clues" in the queries, such as meaningful variable names and inline comments. Finally, we evaluate our approach over the real-world Bgee gene expression knowledge graph and we show that semantic clues can improve model performance by up to 33% compared to a baseline with random variable names and no comments included.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of SWAT4HCLS 2024: Semantic Web Tools and Applications for Healthcare and Life Sciences</p></details> |
| **[ML-Powered Index Tuning: An Overview of Recent Progress and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13641v1)** | 2023-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scale and complexity of workloads in modern cloud services have brought into sharper focus a critical challenge in automated index tuning -- the need to recommend high-quality indexes while maintaining index tuning scalability. This challenge is further compounded by the requirement for automated index implementations to introduce minimal query performance regressions in production deployments, representing a significant barrier to achieving scalability and full automation. This paper directs attention to these challenges within automated index tuning and explores ways in which machine learning (ML) techniques provide new opportunities in their mitigation. In particular, we reflect on recent efforts in developing ML techniques for workload selection, candidate index filtering, speeding up index configuration search, reducing the amount of query optimizer calls, and lowering the chances of performance regressions. We highlight the key takeaways from these efforts and underline the gaps that need to be closed for their effective functioning within the traditional index tuning framework. Additionally, we present a preliminary cross-platform design aimed at democratizing index tuning across multiple SQL-like systems -- an imperative in today's continuously expanding data system landscape. We believe our findings will help provide context and impetus to the research and development efforts in automated index tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZIP: An Efficient Zeroth-order Prompt Tuning for Black-box Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06838v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have introduced various approaches for prompt-tuning black-box vision-language models, referred to as black-box prompt-tuning (BBPT). While BBPT has demonstrated considerable potential, it is often found that many existing methods require an excessive number of queries (i.e., function evaluations), which poses a significant challenge in real-world scenarios where the number of allowed queries is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose Zeroth-order Intrinsic-dimensional Prompt-tuning (ZIP), a novel approach that enables efficient and robust prompt optimization in a purely black-box setting. The key idea of ZIP is to reduce the problem dimensionality and the variance of zeroth-order gradient estimates, such that the training is done fast with far less queries. We achieve this by re-parameterizing prompts in low-rank representations and designing intrinsic-dimensional clipping of estimated gradients. We evaluate ZIP on 13+ vision-language tasks in standard benchmarks and show that it achieves an average improvement of approximately 6% in few-shot accuracy and 48% in query efficiency compared to the best-performing alternative BBPT methods, establishing a new state of the art. Our ablation analysis further shows that the proposed clipping mechanism is robust and nearly optimal, without the need to manually select the clipping threshold, matching the result of expensive hyperparameter search.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards application-specific query processing systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09671v1)** | 2020-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database systems use query processing subsystems for enabling efficient query-based data retrieval. An essential aspect of designing any query-intensive application is tuning the query system to fit the application's requirements and workload characteristics. However, the configuration parameters provided by traditional database systems do not cover the design decisions and trade-offs that arise from the geo-distribution of users and data. In this paper, we present a vision towards a new type of query system architecture that addresses this challenge by enabling query systems to be designed and deployed in a per use case basis. We propose a distributed abstraction called Query Processing Unit that encapsulates primitive query processing tasks, and show how it can be used as a building block for assembling query systems. Using this approach, application architects can construct query systems specialized to their use cases, by controlling the query system's architecture and the placement of its state. We demonstrate the expressiveness of this approach by applying it to the design of a query system that can flexibly place its state in the data center or at the edge, and show that state placement decisions affect the trade-off between query response time and query result freshness.</p></details> |  |

We followed a 2-phase method for producing a ranking of passages for a given input query: In the the first phase, the user's query is expanded by appending 3 queries generated by a transformer model which was trained to rephrase an input query into semantically similar queries. The expanded query can exhibit greater similarity in surface form and vocabulary overlap with the passages of interest and can therefore serve as enriched input to any downstream information retrieval method. In the second phase, we use a BERT-based model pre-trained for language modeling but fine-tuned for query - document relevance prediction to compute relevance scores for a set of 1000 candidate passages per query and subsequently obtain a ranking of passages by sorting them based on the predicted relevance scores. According to the results published in the official Overview of the TREC Deep Learning Track 2019, our team ranked 3rd in the passage retrieval task (including full ranking and re-ranking), and 2nd when considering only re-ranking submissions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Self-Rehearsal: A Fine-Tuning Approach to Improve Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04787v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific datasets is a common practice to improve performance on target tasks. However, this performance gain often leads to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in either the task or the characteristics of the training data, resulting in a loss of generalization. This paper introduces Selective Self-Rehearsal (SSR), a fine-tuning approach that achieves performance comparable to the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while improving generalization. SSR leverages the fact that there can be multiple valid responses to a query. By utilizing the model's correct responses, SSR reduces model specialization during the fine-tuning stage. SSR first identifies the correct model responses from the training set by deploying an appropriate LLM as a judge. Then, it fine-tunes the model using the correct model responses and the gold response for the remaining samples. The effectiveness of SSR is demonstrated through experiments on the task of identifying unanswerable queries across various datasets. The results show that standard SFT can lead to an average performance drop of up to $16.7\%$ on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and TruthfulQA. In contrast, SSR results in close to $2\%$ drop on average, indicating better generalization capabilities compared to standard SFT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries. Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline, demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code responses compared to baseline coding assistants.</p></details> |  |

To provide additional information regarding the query and enhance the performance of intent detection, we propose a method for semantic expansion of spoken queries, called ConQX, which utilizes the text generation ability of an auto-regressive language model, GPT-2. To avoid off-topic text generation, we condition the input query to a structured context with prompt mining. We then apply zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning. We lastly use the expanded queries to fine-tune BERT and RoBERTa for intent detection. The experimental results show that the performance of intent detection can be improved by our semantic expansion method.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, conference</p></details> |

However, their susceptibility to generating harmful content when exposed to unsafe queries raises critical safety concerns. While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the ''safety mirage'', where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over-prudence, causing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address these issues, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised safety fine-tuning, as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly removes harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general capabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to 60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%.

However, existing methods often rely on black-box models with opaque reasoning. We introduce RePanda, a structured fact verification approach that translates claims into executable pandas queries, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. To train RePanda, we construct PanTabFact, a structured dataset derived from the TabFact train set, where claims are paired with executable queries generated using DeepSeek-Chat and refined through automated error correction. Fine-tuning DeepSeek-coder-7B-instruct-v1.5 on PanTabFact, RePanda achieves 84.09% accuracy on the TabFact test set. To evaluate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, we interpret question-answer pairs from WikiTableQuestions as factual claims and refer to this dataset as WikiFact. Without additional fine-tuning, RePanda achieves 84.72% accuracy on WikiFact, significantly outperforming all other baselines and demonstrating strong OOD robustness. Notably, these results closely match the zero-shot performance of DeepSeek-Chat (671B), indicating that our fine-tuning approach effectively distills structured reasoning from a much larger model into a compact, locally executable 7B model. Beyond fact verification, RePanda extends to tabular question answering by generating executable queries that retrieve precise answers. To support this, we introduce PanWiki, a dataset mapping WikiTableQuestions to pandas queries. Fine-tuning on PanWiki, RePanda achieves 75.1% accuracy in direct answer retrieval. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured execution-based reasoning for tabular verification and question answering. We have publicly released the dataset on Hugging Face at datasets/AtoosaChegini/PanTabFact.</p></details> |  |

However, the original Promptagator approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CIKM ...</summary><p>CIKM 2025 short research paper</p></details> |

To address this issue, safety filters are often added on top of text-to-image models, or the models themselves are aligned to reduce harmful outputs. However, these defenses remain vulnerable when an attacker strategically designs adversarial prompts to bypass these safety guardrails. In this work, we propose PromptTune, a method to jailbreak text-to-image models with safety guardrails using a fine-tuned large language model. Unlike other query-based jailbreak attacks that require repeated queries to the target model, our attack generates adversarial prompts efficiently after fine-tuning our AttackLLM. We evaluate our method on three datasets of unsafe prompts and against five safety guardrails. Our results demonstrate that our approach effectively bypasses safety guardrails, outperforms existing no-box attacks, and also facilitates other query-based attacks.</p></details> |  |

Recent works tackled this task by improving query inputs with large pre-trained language models (PLM) at the cost of more expensive training. However, the effects of this integration are unclear, as these works also propose improvements in the visual inputs. Therefore, this paper studies the effects of PLMs in TVG and assesses the applicability of parameter-efficient training with NLP adapters. We couple popular PLMs with a selection of existing approaches and test different adapters to reduce the impact of the additional parameters. Our results on three challenging datasets show that, without changing the visual inputs, TVG models greatly benefited from the PLM integration and fine-tuning, stressing the importance of sentence query representation in this task. Furthermore, NLP adapters were an effective alternative to full fine-tuning, even though they were not tailored to our task, allowing PLM integration in larger TVG models and delivering results comparable to SOTA models. Finally, our results shed light on which adapters work best in different scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Findings of ACL2023</p></details> |

However, in opinion summarization, large annotated datasets of reviews paired with reference summaries are not available and would be expensive to create. This calls for fine-tuning methods robust to overfitting on small datasets. In addition, generically pre-trained models are often not accustomed to the specifics of customer reviews and, after fine-tuning, yield summaries with disfluencies and semantic mistakes. To address these problems, we utilize an efficient few-shot method based on adapters which, as we show, can easily store in-domain knowledge. Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, we add adapters and pre-train them in a task-specific way on a large corpus of unannotated customer reviews, using held-out reviews as pseudo summaries. Then, fine-tune the adapters on the small available human-annotated dataset. We show that this self-supervised adapter pre-training improves summary quality over standard fine-tuning by 2.0 and 1.3 ROUGE-L points on the Amazon and Yelp datasets, respectively. Finally, for summary personalization, we condition on aspect keyword queries, automatically created from generic datasets. In the same vein, we pre-train the adapters in a query-based manner on customer reviews and then fine-tune them on annotated datasets. This results in better-organized summary content reflected in improved coherence and fewer redundancies.</p></details> | NAACL Findings 2022 |

In this article, we discuss some cases where random forests may suffer and propose a novel generalized RF method, namely regression-enhanced random forests (RERFs), that can improve on RFs by borrowing the strength of penalized parametric regression. The algorithm for constructing RERFs and selecting its tuning parameters is described. Both simulation study and real data examples show that RERFs have better predictive performance than RFs in important situations often encountered in practice. Moreover, RERFs may incorporate known relationships between the response and the predictors, and may give reliable predictions in extrapolation problems where predictions are required at points out of the domain of the training dataset. Strategies analogous to those described here can be used to improve other machine learning methods via combination with penalized parametric regression techniques.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Quantile Regression using Random Forest Proximities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02355v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the dynamic nature of financial markets, maintaining models that produce precise predictions over time is difficult. Often the goal isn't just point prediction but determining uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty, especially the aleatoric uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of market drivers, helps investors understand varying risk levels. Recently, quantile regression forests (QRF) have emerged as a promising solution: Unlike most basic quantile regression methods that need separate models for each quantile, quantile regression forests estimate the entire conditional distribution of the target variable with a single model, while retaining all the salient features of a typical random forest. We introduce a novel approach to compute quantile regressions from random forests that leverages the proximity (i.e., distance metric) learned by the model and infers the conditional distribution of the target variable. We evaluate the proposed methodology using publicly available datasets and then apply it towards the problem of forecasting the average daily volume of corporate bonds. We show that using quantile regression using Random Forest proximities demonstrates superior performance in approximating conditional target distributions and prediction intervals to the original version of QRF. We also demonstrate that the proposed framework is significantly more computationally efficient than traditional approaches to quantile regressions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Although random forest models perform well in these tasks, they are often difficult to interpret. Interpretability is crucial in machine learning, especially when it can directly impact human well-being. Although model-agnostic techniques exist for multi-target regression, specific techniques tailored to random forest models are not available. To address this issue, we propose a technique that provides rule-based interpretations for instances made by a random forest model for multi-target regression, influenced by a recent model-specific technique for random forest interpretability. The proposed technique was evaluated through extensive experiments and shown to offer competitive interpretations compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, to be submitted to XAI conference 2023 as an extended abstract</p></details> |

The randomForestSRC package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC) is a unified treatment of Breiman's random forests for survival, regression and classification problems. Predictive accuracy make RF an attractive alternative to parametric models, though complexity and interpretability of the forest hinder wider application of the method. We introduce the ggRandomForests package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=ggRandomForests), for visually understand random forest models grown in R with the randomForestSRC package. The vignette is a tutorial for using the ggRandomForests package with the randomForestSRC package for building and post-processing a regression random forest. In this tutorial, we explore a random forest model for the Boston Housing Data, available in the MASS package. We grow a random forest for regression and demonstrate how ggRandomForests can be used when determining variable associations, interactions and how the response depends on predictive variables within the model. The tutorial demonstrates the design and usage of many of ggRandomForests functions and features how to modify and customize the resulting ggplot2 graphic objects along the way. A development version of the ggRandomForests package is available on Github. We invite comments, feature requests and bug reports for this package at (https://github.com/ehrlinger/ggRandomForests).</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 page, 16 figures.

| **[Covariance regression with random forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08173v3)** | 2023-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capturing the conditional covariances or correlations among the elements of a multivariate response vector based on covariates is important to various fields including neuroscience, epidemiology and biomedicine. We propose a new method called Covariance Regression with Random Forests (CovRegRF) to estimate the covariance matrix of a multivariate response given a set of covariates, using a random forest framework. Random forest trees are built with a splitting rule specially designed to maximize the difference between the sample covariance matrix estimates of the child nodes. We also propose a significance test for the partial effect of a subset of covariates. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method and significance test through a simulation study which shows that the proposed method provides accurate covariance matrix estimates and that the Type-1 error is well controlled. An application of the proposed method to thyroid disease data is also presented. CovRegRF is implemented in a freely available R package on CRAN.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[Random Forest Weighted Local Fréchet Regression with Random Objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04912v5)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical analysis is increasingly confronted with complex data from metric spaces. Petersen and Müller (2019) established a general paradigm of Fréchet regression with complex metric space valued responses and Euclidean predictors. However, the local approach therein involves nonparametric kernel smoothing and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we in this paper propose a novel random forest weighted local Fréchet regression paradigm. The main mechanism of our approach relies on a locally adaptive kernel generated by random forests. Our first method uses these weights as the local average to solve the conditional Fréchet mean, while the second method performs local linear Fréchet regression, both significantly improving existing Fréchet regression methods. Based on the theory of infinite order U-processes and infinite order $M_{m_n}$-estimator, we establish the consistency, rate of convergence, and asymptotic normality for our local constant estimator, which covers the current large sample theory of random forests with Euclidean responses as a special case. Numerical studies show the superiority of our methods with several commonly encountered types of responses such as distribution functions, symmetric positive-definite matrices, and sphere data. The practical merits of our proposals are also demonstrated through the application to New York taxi data and human mortality data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Time series quantile regression using random forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02273v1)** | 2022-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discuss an application of Generalized Random Forests (GRF) proposed by Athey et al.(2019) to quantile regression for time series data. We extracted the theoretical results of the GRF consistency for i.i.d. data to time series data. In particular, in the main theorem, based only on the general assumptions for time series data in Davis and Nielsen (2020), and trees in Athey et al.(2019), we show that the tsQRF (time series Quantile Regression Forests) estimator is consistent. Davis and Nielsen (2020) also discussed the estimation problem using Random Forests (RF) for time series data, but the construction procedure of the RF treated by the GRF is essentially different, and different ideas are used throughout the theoretical proof. In addition, a simulation and real data analysis were conducted.In the simulation, the accuracy of the conditional quantile estimation was evaluated under time series models. In the real data using the Nikkei Stock Average, our estimator is demonstrated to be more sensitive than the others in terms of volatility, thus preventing underestimation of risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regression with Missing Data, a Comparison Study of TechniquesBased on Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09333v1)** | 2021-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we present the practical benefits of a new random forest algorithm to deal withmissing values in the sample. The purpose of this work is to compare the different solutionsto deal with missing values with random forests and describe our new algorithm performanceas well as its algorithmic complexity. A variety of missing value mechanisms (such as MCAR,MAR, MNAR) are considered and simulated. We study the quadratic errors and the bias ofour algorithm and compare it to the most popular missing values random forests algorithms inthe literature. In particular, we compare those techniques for both a regression and predictionpurpose. This work follows a first paper Gomez-Mendez and Joly (2020) on the consistency ofthis new algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Spatial Regression to Random Forests for Large Environmental Data Sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10236v1)** | 2018-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental data may be "large" due to number of records, number of covariates, or both. Random forests has a reputation for good predictive performance when using many covariates with nonlinear relationships, whereas spatial regression, when using reduced rank methods, has a reputation for good predictive performance when using many records that are spatially autocorrelated. In this study, we compare these two techniques using a data set containing the macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) at 1859 stream sites with over 200 landscape covariates. A primary application is mapping MMI predictions and prediction errors at 1.1 million perennial stream reaches across the conterminous United States. For the spatial regression model, we develop a novel transformation procedure that estimates Box-Cox transformations to linearize covariate relationships and handles possibly zero-inflated covariates. We find that the spatial regression model with transformations, and a subsequent selection of significant covariates, has cross-validation performance slightly better than random forests. We also find that prediction interval coverage is close to nominal for each method, but that spatial regression prediction intervals tend to be narrower and have less variability than quantile regression forest prediction intervals. A simulation study is used to generalize results and clarify advantages of each modeling approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized random forest for extreme quantile regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15095v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantile regression is a statistical method which, unlike classical regression, aims to predict the conditional quantiles. Classical quantile regression methods face difficulties, particularly when the quantile under consideration is extreme, due to the limited number of data available in the tail of the distribution, or when the quantile function is complex. We propose an extreme quantile regression method based on extreme value theory and statistical learning to overcome these difficulties. Following the Block Maxima approach of extreme value theory, we approximate the conditional distribution of block maxima by the generalized extreme value distribution, with covariate-dependent parameters. These parameters are estimated using a method based on generalized random forests. Applications on simulated data show that our proposed method effectively addresses the mentioned quantile regression issues and highlights its performance compared to other quantile regression approaches based on statistical learning methods. We apply our methodology to daily meteorological data from the Fort Collins station in Colorado (USA).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Random Forests: Heterogeneity Adjustment and Multivariate Distributional Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14458v3)** | 2022-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) is a successful and widely used regression and classification algorithm. Part of its appeal and reason for its versatility is its (implicit) construction of a kernel-type weighting function on training data, which can also be used for targets other than the original mean estimation. We propose a novel forest construction for multivariate responses based on their joint conditional distribution, independent of the estimation target and the data model. It uses a new splitting criterion based on the MMD distributional metric, which is suitable for detecting heterogeneity in multivariate distributions. The induced weights define an estimate of the full conditional distribution, which in turn can be used for arbitrary and potentially complicated targets of interest. The method is very versatile and convenient to use, as we illustrate on a wide range of examples. The code is available as Python and R packages drf.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Best-scored Random Forest for Large-scale Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03438v1)** | 2019-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method designed for large-scale regression problems, namely the two-stage best-scored random forest (TBRF). "Best-scored" means to select one regression tree with the best empirical performance out of a certain number of purely random regression tree candidates, and "two-stage" means to divide the original random tree splitting procedure into two: In stage one, the feature space is partitioned into non-overlapping cells; in stage two, child trees grow separately on these cells. The strengths of this algorithm can be summarized as follows: First of all, the pure randomness in TBRF leads to the almost optimal learning rates, and also makes ensemble learning possible, which resolves the boundary discontinuities long plaguing the existing algorithms. Secondly, the two-stage procedure paves the way for parallel computing, leading to computational efficiency. Last but not least, TBRF can serve as an inclusive framework where different mainstream regression strategies such as linear predictor and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) can also be incorporated as value assignment approaches on leaves of the child trees, depending on the characteristics of the underlying data sets. Numerical assessments on comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on several large-scale real data sets validate the promising prediction accuracy and high computational efficiency of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Notion of Feature Importance by Decorrelation and Detection of Trends by Random Forest Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01156v1)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many studies, we want to determine the influence of certain features on a dependent variable. More specifically, we are interested in the strength of the influence -- i.e., is the feature relevant? -- and, if so, how the feature influences the dependent variable. Recently, data-driven approaches such as \emph{random forest regression} have found their way into applications (Boulesteix et al., 2012). These models allow to directly derive measures of feature importance, which are a natural indicator of the strength of the influence. For the relevant features, the correlation or rank correlation between the feature and the dependent variable has typically been used to determine the nature of the influence. More recent methods, some of which can also measure interactions between features, are based on a modeling approach. In particular, when machine learning models are used, SHAP scores are a recent and prominent method to determine these trends (Lundberg et al., 2017). In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feature importance based on the well-studied Gram-Schmidt decorrelation method. Furthermore, we propose two estimators for identifying trends in the data using random forest regression, the so-called absolute and relative transversal rate. We empirically compare the properties of our estimators with those of well-established estimators on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Forest regression for manifold-valued responses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08381v2)** | 2017-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing array of biomedical and computer vision applications requires the predictive modeling of complex data, for example images and shapes. The main challenge when predicting such objects lies in the fact that they do not comply to the assumptions of Euclidean geometry. Rather, they occupy non-linear spaces, a.k.a. manifolds, where it is difficult to define concepts such as coordinates, vectors and expected values. In this work, we construct a non-parametric predictive methodology for manifold-valued objects, based on a distance modification of the Random Forest algorithm. Our method is versatile and can be applied both in cases where the response space is a well-defined manifold, but also when such knowledge is not available. Model fitting and prediction phases only require the definition of a suitable distance function for the observed responses. We validate our methodology using simulations and apply it on a series of illustrative image completion applications, showcasing superior predictive performance, compared to various established regression methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Testing for Regression Heteroskedasticity with High-Dimensional Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02101v1)** | 2022-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical inference for high-dimensional regression heteroskedasticity is an important but under-explored problem. The current paper aims at filling this gap by proposing two tests, namely the variance difference test and the variance difference Breusch-Pagan test, for assessing high-dimensional regression heteroskedasticity. The former tests whether an explanatory feature of interest is associated with the conditional variance of a response variable, while the latter tests heteroskedasticity in the regression, which is known to be the Breusch-Pagan test problem. To formally establish the tests, we have derived rigorous P-values and test sizes, and analyzed the test power under a nonparametric heteroskedastic data generating model with high-dimensional input features. Such a model setting takes into account high-dimensional applications with flexible structures of heteroskedasticity and features having interaction effects on the mean of the response; these are common applications in many fields such as biology. Our methods leverage machine learning mean prediction methods such as random forests and use knockoff variables as negative controls. Particularly, the definition of knockoffs for our test statistics is more flexible than the original definition of knockoffs, and we give a detailed comparison of these two definitions and discuss the advantages of our knockoffs. The satisfactory empirical performance of the proposed tests is illustrated with simulation results and an HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) case study.</p></details> | <details><summary>113 p...</summary><p>113 pages, 1 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Output Random Forest Regression to Emulate the Earliest Stages of Planet Formation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12845v1)** | 2021-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current paradigm of planet formation research, it is believed that the first step to forming massive bodies (such as asteroids and planets) requires that small interstellar dust grains floating through space collide with each other and grow to larger sizes. The initial formation of these pebbles is governed by an integro-differential equation known as the Smoluchowski coagulation equation, to which analytical solutions are intractable for all but the simplest possible scenarios. While brute-force methods of approximation have been developed, they are computationally costly, currently making it infeasible to simulate this process including other physical processes relevant to planet formation, and across the very large range of scales on which it occurs. In this paper, we take a machine learning approach to designing a system for a much faster approximation. We develop a multi-output random forest regression model trained on brute-force simulation data to approximate distributions of dust particle sizes in protoplanetary disks at different points in time. The performance of our random forest model is measured against the existing brute-force models, which are the standard for realistic simulations. Results indicate that the random forest model can generate highly accurate predictions relative to the brute-force simulation results, with an $R^{2}$ of 0.97, and do so significantly faster than brute-force methods.</p></details> |  |

The data consist of satellite measurements of cloud systems which are to be classified either in convective or non convective systems. Convective cloud systems correspond to lightning and detecting such systems is of main importance for thunderstorm monitoring and warning. Because the problem is highly unbalanced, we consider specific performance criteria and different strategies. This case study can be used in an advanced course of data mining in order to illustrate the use of logistic regression and random forest on a real data set with unbalanced classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Forest Regression Feature Importance for Climate Impact Pathway Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16609v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disturbances to the climate system, both natural and anthropogenic, have far reaching impacts that are not always easy to identify or quantify using traditional climate science analyses or causal modeling techniques. In this paper, we develop a novel technique for discovering and ranking the chain of spatio-temporal downstream impacts of a climate source, referred to herein as a source-impact pathway, using Random Forest Regression (RFR) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) feature importances. Rather than utilizing RFR for classification or regression tasks (the most common use case for RFR), we propose a fundamentally new workflow in which we: (i) train random forest (RF) regressors on a set of spatio-temporal features of interest, (ii) calculate their pair-wise feature importances using the SHAP weights associated with those features, and (iii) translate these feature importances into a weighted pathway network (i.e., a weighted directed graph), which can be used to trace out and rank interdependencies between climate features and/or modalities. Importantly, while herein we employ RFR and SHAP feature importance in steps (i) and (ii) of our algorithm, our novel workflow is in no way tied to these approaches, which could be replaced with any regression method and sensitivity method. We adopt a tiered verification approach to verify our new pathway identification methodology. In this approach, we apply our method to ensembles of data generated by running two increasingly complex benchmarks: (i) a set of synthetic coupled equations, and (ii) a fully coupled simulation of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines performed using a modified version 2 of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv2). We find that our RFR feature importance-based approach can accurately detect known pathways of impact for both test cases.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a dataset comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model, achieving high predictive performance as evidenced by R2 scores and Mean Squared Errors (MSE). The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in providing accurate predictions, which is validated through various performance metrics including residual plots and learning curves. The findings underscore the potential of ensemble learning techniques in enhancing material property predictions, with implications for industrial applications in material science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Credit spread approximation and improvement using random forest regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07358v1)** | 2021-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit Default Swap (CDS) levels provide a market appreciation of companies' default risk. These derivatives are not always available, creating a need for CDS approximations. This paper offers a simple, global and transparent CDS structural approximation, which contrasts with more complex and proprietary approximations currently in use. This Equity-to-Credit formula (E2C), inspired by CreditGrades, obtains better CDS approximations, according to empirical analyses based on a large sample spanning 2016-2018. A random forest regression run with this E2C formula and selected additional financial data results in an 87.3% out-of-sample accuracy in CDS approximations. The transparency property of this algorithm confirms the predominance of the E2C estimate, and the impact of companies' debt rating and size, in predicting their CDS.</p></details> |  |
| **[S-SIRUS: an explainability algorithm for spatial regression Random Forest](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05537v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Forest (RF) is a widely used machine learning algorithm known for its flexibility, user-friendliness, and high predictive performance across various domains. However, it is non-interpretable. This can limit its usefulness in applied sciences, where understanding the relationships between predictors and response variable is crucial from a decision-making perspective. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to explain RF, but none of them addresses the challenge of explaining RF in the context of spatially dependent data. Therefore, this work aims to explain regression RF in the case of spatially dependent data by extracting a compact and simple list of rules. In this respect, we propose S-SIRUS, a spatial extension of SIRUS, the latter being a well-established regression rule algorithm able to extract a stable and short list of rules from the classical regression RF algorithm. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the explainability capability of the proposed S-SIRUS, in comparison to SIRUS, by considering different levels of spatial dependence among the data. The results suggest that S-SIRUS exhibits a higher test predictive accuracy than SIRUS when spatial correlation is present. Moreover, for higher levels of spatial correlation, S-SIRUS produces a shorter list of rules, easing the explanation of the mechanism behind the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Forest (RF) Kernel for Regression, Classification and Survival](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00089v1)** | 2020-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breiman's random forest (RF) can be interpreted as an implicit kernel generator,where the ensuing proximity matrix represents the data-driven RF kernel. Kernel perspective on the RF has been used to develop a principled framework for theoretical investigation of its statistical properties. However, practical utility of the links between kernels and the RF has not been widely explored and systematically evaluated.Focus of our work is investigation of the interplay between kernel methods and the RF. We elucidate the performance and properties of the data driven RF kernels used by regularized linear models in a comprehensive simulation study comprising of continuous, binary and survival targets. We show that for continuous and survival targets, the RF kernels are competitive to RF in higher dimensional scenarios with larger number of noisy features. For the binary target, the RF kernel and RF exhibit comparable performance. As the RF kernel asymptotically converges to the Laplace kernel, we included it in our evaluation. For most simulation setups, the RF and RFkernel outperformed the Laplace kernel. Nevertheless, in some cases the Laplace kernel was competitive, showing its potential value for applications. We also provide the results from real life data sets for the regression, classification and survival to illustrate how these insights may be leveraged in practice.Finally, we discuss further extensions of the RF kernels in the context of interpretable prototype and landmarking classification, regression and survival. We outline future line of research for kernels furnished by Bayesian counterparts of the RF.</p></details> |  |

The variables selection is based on an automatic machine learning method using regression trees, and random forests combined with stratified two levels cross validation. The minimum threshold of variables importance is accessed using the quadratic distance of variables importance while the optimal subset of selected variables is used to perform predictions. Finally the results revealed to be qualitatively better, at the selection, the prediction , and the CPU time point of view than those obtained by GLM-Lasso method.</p></details> |  |

We compare the performance of Bayesian additive regression trees, Cox proportional hazards and random survival forests models for censored survival data, using simulation studies and survival analysis for breast cancer with U.S. SEER database for the year 2005. In simulation studies, we compare the three models across varying sample sizes and censoring rates on the basis of bias and prediction accuracy. In survival analysis for breast cancer, we retrospectively analyze a subset of 1500 patients having invasive ductal carcinoma that is a common form of breast cancer mostly affecting older woman. Predictive potential of the three models are then compared using some widely used performance assessment measures in survival literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[A path in regression Random Forest looking for spatial dependence: a taxonomy and a systematic review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04693v2)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Forest (RF) is a well-known data-driven algorithm applied in several fields thanks to its flexibility in modeling the relationship between the response variable and the predictors, also in case of strong non-linearities. In environmental applications, it often occurs that the phenomenon of interest may present spatial and/or temporal dependence that is not taken explicitly into account by RF in its standard version. In this work, we propose a taxonomy to classify strategies according to when (Pre-, In- and/or Post-processing) they try to include the spatial information into regression RF. Moreover, we provide a systematic review and classify the most recent strategies adopted to "adjust" regression RF to spatially dependent data, based on the criteria provided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The latter consists of a reproducible methodology for collecting and processing existing literature on a specified topic from different sources. PRISMA starts with a query and ends with a set of scientific documents to review: we performed an online query on the 25$^{th}$ October 2022 and, in the end, 32 documents were considered for review. The employed methodological strategies and the application fields considered in the 32 scientific documents are described and discussed.

| **[variable selection and missing data imputation in categorical genomic data analysis by integrated ridge regression and random forest](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05714v1)** | 2021-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic data arising from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) are often not only of large-scale, but also incomplete. A specific form of their incompleteness is missing values with non-ignorable missingness mechanism. The intrinsic complications of genomic data present significant challenges in developing an unbiased and informative procedure of phenotype-genotype association analysis by a statistical variable selection approach. In this paper we develop a coherent procedure of categorical phenotype-genotype association analysis, in the presence of missing values with non-ignorable missingness mechanism in GWAS data, by integrating the state-of-the-art methods of random forest for variable selection, weighted ridge regression with EM algorithm for missing data imputation, and linear statistical hypothesis testing for determining the missingness mechanism. Two simulated GWAS are used to validate the performance of the proposed procedure. The procedure is then applied to analyze a real data set from breast cancer GWAS.</p></details> |  |

This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9Page...</summary><p>9Pages, 3 Figures and 5 Tables</p></details> |

This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR), Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS, adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based policymaking in global health contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving Random Forest Proximities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12682v2)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests are considered one of the best out-of-the-box classification and regression algorithms due to their high level of predictive performance with relatively little tuning. Pairwise proximities can be computed from a trained random forest and measure the similarity between data points relative to the supervised task. Random forest proximities have been used in many applications including the identification of variable importance, data imputation, outlier detection, and data visualization. However, existing definitions of random forest proximities do not accurately reflect the data geometry learned by the random forest. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest-Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving proximities (RF-GAP). We prove that the proximity-weighted sum (regression) or majority vote (classification) using RF-GAP exactly matches the out-of-bag random forest prediction, thus capturing the data geometry learned by the random forest. We empirically show that this improved geometric representation outperforms traditional random forest proximities in tasks such as data imputation and provides outlier detection and visualization results consistent with the learned data geometry.</p></details> |  |

| **[Analysis of purely random forests bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.3939v1)** | 2014-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests are a very effective and commonly used statistical method, but their full theoretical analysis is still an open problem. As a first step, simplified models such as purely random forests have been introduced, in order to shed light on the good performance of random forests. In this paper, we study the approximation error (the bias) of some purely random forest models in a regression framework, focusing in particular on the influence of the number of trees in the forest. Under some regularity assumptions on the regression function, we show that the bias of an infinite forest decreases at a faster rate (with respect to the size of each tree) than a single tree. As a consequence, infinite forests attain a strictly better risk rate (with respect to the sample size) than single trees. Furthermore, our results allow to derive a minimum number of trees sufficient to reach the same rate as an infinite forest. As a by-product of our analysis, we also show a link between the bias of purely random forests and the bias of some kernel estimators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Attention Forests: Transformer-Based Forest Improvement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05980v1)** | 2023-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new approach called NAF (the Neural Attention Forest) for solving regression and classification tasks under tabular training data is proposed. The main idea behind the proposed NAF model is to introduce the attention mechanism into the random forest by assigning attention weights calculated by neural networks of a specific form to data in leaves of decision trees and to the random forest itself in the framework of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression. In contrast to the available models like the attention-based random forest, the attention weights and the Nadaraya-Watson regression are represented in the form of neural networks whose weights can be regarded as trainable parameters. The first part of neural networks with shared weights is trained for all trees and computes attention weights of data in leaves. The second part aggregates outputs of the tree networks and aims to minimize the difference between the random forest prediction and the truth target value from a training set. The neural network is trained in an end-to-end manner. The combination of the random forest and neural networks implementing the attention mechanism forms a transformer for enhancing the forest predictions. Numerical experiments with real datasets illustrate the proposed method. The code implementing the approach is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for the 7th International Scientific Conference "Intelligent Information Technologies for Industry" in St. Petersburg</p></details> |

Taking the perspective of random forests as an adaptive kernel method, we pair the forest kernel with a local linear regression adjustment to better capture smoothness. The resulting procedure, local linear forests, enables us to improve on asymptotic rates of convergence for random forests with smooth signals, and provides substantial gains in accuracy on both real and simulated data. We prove a central limit theorem valid under regularity conditions on the forest and smoothness constraints, and propose a computationally efficient construction for confidence intervals. Moving to a causal inference application, we discuss the merits of local regression adjustments for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and give an example on a dataset exploring the effect word choice has on attitudes to the social safety net. Last, we include simulation results on real and generated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics</p></details> |

One interesting example is the Mondrian random forest, in which the underlying constituent trees are constructed via a Mondrian process. We give precise bias and variance characterizations, along with a Berry-Esseen-type central limit theorem, for the Mondrian random forest regression estimator. By combining these results with a carefully crafted debiasing approach and an accurate variance estimator, we present valid statistical inference methods for the unknown regression function. These methods come with explicitly characterized error bounds in terms of the sample size, tree complexity parameter, and number of trees in the forest, and include coverage error rates for feasible confidence interval estimators. Our debiasing procedure for the Mondrian random forest also allows it to achieve the minimax-optimal point estimation convergence rate in mean squared error for multivariate $β$-Hölder regression functions, for all $β> 0$, provided that the underlying tuning parameters are chosen appropriately. Efficient and implementable algorithms are devised for both batch and online learning settings, and we study the computational complexity of different Mondrian random forest implementations. Finally, simulations with synthetic data validate our theory and methodology, demonstrating their excellent finite-sample properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |

Based on a local adaptive representation of random forests, we develop its regression adjustment for randomly censored regression quantile models. Regression adjustment is based on new estimating equations that adapt to censoring and lead to quantile score whenever the data do not exhibit censoring. The proposed procedure named censored quantile regression forest, allows us to estimate quantiles of time-to-event without any parametric modeling assumption. We establish its consistency under mild model specifications. Numerical studies showcase a clear advantage of the proposed procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical and Empirical Advances in Forest Pruning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05535v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regression forests have long delivered state-of-the-art accuracy, often outperforming regression trees and even neural networks, but they suffer from limited interpretability as ensemble methods. In this work, we revisit forest pruning, an approach that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of regression forests and the interpretability of regression trees. This pursuit, whose foundation lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast success in empirical studies. In this paper, we contribute theoretical results that support and qualify those empirical findings; namely, we prove the asymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over its unpruned counterpart under weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample generalization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main methods, which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the accuracy of pruned regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19 different datasets (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of scenarios tested, there is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal or better accuracy than the original full forest (in expectation), while just using a small fraction of the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction in the size of the forest is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be meaningfully merged into a single tree, obtaining a level of interpretability that is qualitatively superior to that of the original regression forest, which remains a black box.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |

However, the means by which this is accomplished is unprincipled: one simply counts the fraction of trees in a forest that vote for a certain class. In this paper, we forge a connection between random forests and kernel regression. This places random forest probability estimation on more sound statistical footing. As part of our investigation, we develop a model for the proximity kernel and relate it to the geometry and sparsity of the estimation problem. We also provide intuition and recommendations for tuning a random forest to improve its probability estimates.</p></details> |  |

Despite their empirical success as well as a bevy of recent work investigating their statistical properties, a full and satisfying explanation for their success has yet to be put forth. Here we aim to take a step forward in this direction by demonstrating that the additional randomness injected into individual trees serves as a form of implicit regularization, making random forests an ideal model in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. Specifically, from a model-complexity perspective, we show that the mtry parameter in random forests serves much the same purpose as the shrinkage penalty in explicitly regularized regression procedures like lasso and ridge regression. To highlight this point, we design a randomized linear-model-based forward selection procedure intended as an analogue to tree-based random forests and demonstrate its surprisingly strong empirical performance. Numerous demonstrations on both real and synthetic data are provided.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)</p></details> |

The models can be regarded as extensions of the attention-based random forest whose idea stems from applying a combination of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression and the Huber's contamination model to random forests. The self-attention aims to capture dependencies of the tree predictions and to remove noise or anomalous predictions in the random forest. The self-attention module is trained jointly with the attention module for computing weights. It is shown that the training process of attention weights is reduced to solving a single quadratic or linear optimization problem. Three modifications of the general approach are proposed and compared. A specific multi-head self-attention for the random forest is also considered. Heads of the self-attention are obtained by changing its tuning parameters including the kernel parameters and the contamination parameter of models. Numerical experiments with various datasets illustrate the proposed models and show that the supplement of the self-attention improves the model performance for many datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2201.02880</p></details> |
| **[A Random Forest Approach for Modeling Bounded Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06211v1)** | 2019-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests have become an established tool for classification and regression, in particular in high-dimensional settings and in the presence of complex predictor-response relationships. For bounded outcome variables restricted to the unit interval, however, classical random forest approaches may severely suffer as they do not account for the heteroscedasticity in the data. A random forest approach is proposed for relating beta distributed outcomes to explanatory variables. The approach explicitly makes use of the likelihood function of the beta distribution for the selection of splits during the tree-building procedure. In each iteration of the tree-building algorithm one chooses the combination of explanatory variable and splitting rule that maximizes the log-likelihood function of the beta distribution with the parameter estimates derived from the nodes of the currently built tree. Several simulation studies demonstrate the properties of the method and compare its performance to classical random forest approaches as well as to parametric regression models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, the state-of-the-art quality-based PI estimation methods are based on deep neural networks or linear models. In this paper, we propose Highest Density Interval Regression Forest (HDI-Forest), a novel quality-based PI estimation method that is instead based on Random Forest. HDI-Forest does not require additional model training, and directly reuses the trees learned in a standard Random Forest model. By utilizing the special properties of Random Forest, HDI-Forest could efficiently and more directly optimize the PI quality metrics. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that HDI-Forest significantly outperforms previous approaches, reducing the average PI width by over 20% while achieving the same or better coverage probability</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2019</p></details> |
| **[A Powerful Random Forest Featuring Linear Extensions (RaFFLE)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10185v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests are widely used in regression. However, the decision trees used as base learners are poor approximators of linear relationships. To address this limitation we propose RaFFLE (Random Forest Featuring Linear Extensions), a novel framework that integrates the recently developed PILOT trees (Piecewise Linear Organic Trees) as base learners within a random forest ensemble. PILOT trees combine the computational efficiency of traditional decision trees with the flexibility of linear model trees. To ensure sufficient diversity of the individual trees, we introduce an adjustable regularization parameter and use node-level feature sampling. These modifications improve the accuracy of the forest. We establish theoretical guarantees for the consistency of RaFFLE under weak conditions, and its faster convergence when the data are generated by a linear model. Empirical evaluations on 136 regression datasets demonstrate that RaFFLE outperforms the classical CART and random forest methods, the regularized linear methods Lasso and Ridge, and the state-of-the-art XGBoost algorithm, across both linear and nonlinear datasets. By balancing predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, RaFFLE proves to be a versatile tool for tackling a wide variety of regression problems.</p></details> |  |

Small area estimators are predominantly conceptualized within the regression-setting and rely on linear mixed models to account for the hierarchical structure of the survey data. In contrast, machine learning methods offer non-linear and non-parametric alternatives, combining excellent predictive performance and a reduced risk of model-misspecification. Mixed effects random forests combine advantages of regression forests with the ability to model hierarchical dependencies. This paper provides a coherent framework based on mixed effects random forests for estimating small area averages and proposes a non-parametric bootstrap estimator for assessing the uncertainty of the estimates. We illustrate advantages of our proposed methodology using Mexican income-data from the state Nuevo León. Finally, the methodology is evaluated in model-based and design-based simulations comparing the proposed methodology to traditional regression-based approaches for estimating small area averages.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[Mondrian Forests: Efficient Online Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2673v2)** | 2015-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensembles of randomized decision trees, usually referred to as random forests, are widely used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning and statistics. Random forests achieve competitive predictive performance and are computationally efficient to train and test, making them excellent candidates for real-world prediction tasks. The most popular random forest variants (such as Breiman's random forest and extremely randomized trees) operate on batches of training data. Online methods are now in greater demand. Existing online random forests, however, require more training data than their batch counterpart to achieve comparable predictive performance. In this work, we use Mondrian processes (Roy and Teh, 2009) to construct ensembles of random decision trees we call Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests can be grown in an incremental/online fashion and remarkably, the distribution of online Mondrian forests is the same as that of batch Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests achieve competitive predictive performance comparable with existing online random forests and periodically re-trained batch random forests, while being more than an order of magnitude faster, thus representing a better computation vs accuracy tradeoff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extremal Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12865v3)** | 2024-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical methods for quantile regression fail in cases where the quantile of interest is extreme and only few or no training data points exceed it. Asymptotic results from extreme value theory can be used to extrapolate beyond the range of the data, and several approaches exist that use linear regression, kernel methods or generalized additive models. Most of these methods break down if the predictor space has more than a few dimensions or if the regression function of extreme quantiles is complex. We propose a method for extreme quantile regression that combines the flexibility of random forests with the theory of extrapolation. Our extremal random forest (ERF) estimates the parameters of a generalized Pareto distribution, conditional on the predictor vector, by maximizing a local likelihood with weights extracted from a quantile random forest. We penalize the shape parameter in this likelihood to regularize its variability in the predictor space. Under general domain of attraction conditions, we show consistency of the estimated parameters in both the unpenalized and penalized case. Simulation studies show that our ERF outperforms both classical quantile regression methods and existing regression approaches from extreme value theory. We apply our methodology to extreme quantile prediction for U.S. wage data.</p></details> | 69 pages, 16 figures |

| **[Uncertainty Quantification in Ensembles of Honest Regression Trees using Generalized Fiducial Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06177v1)** | 2019-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their accuracies, methods based on ensembles of regression trees are a popular approach for making predictions. Some common examples include Bayesian additive regression trees, boosting and random forests. This paper focuses on honest random forests, which add honesty to the original form of random forests and are proved to have better statistical properties. The main contribution is a new method that quantifies the uncertainties of the estimates and predictions produced by honest random forests. The proposed method is based on the generalized fiducial methodology, and provides a fiducial density function that measures how likely each single honest tree is the true model. With such a density function, estimates and predictions, as well as their confidence/prediction intervals, can be obtained. The promising empirical properties of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods, and by applications to a few real data sets. Lastly, the proposed method is theoretically backed up by a strong asymptotic guarantee.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the best strategy is not known in advance. Moreover, this strategy usually depends on the problem to be solved. This paper suggests using various regression methods (like random forest, extremely randomized trees, gradient boosting, decision trees, and a generalized linear model) on ensemble strategies in differential evolution algorithm by predicting the best differential evolution strategy during the run. Comparing the preliminary results of this algorithm by optimizing a suite of five well-known functions from literature, it was shown that using the random forest regression method substantially outperformed the results of the other regression methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimax Rates for High-Dimensional Random Tessellation Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10541v5)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests are a popular class of algorithms used for regression and classification. The algorithm introduced by Breiman in 2001 and many of its variants are ensembles of randomized decision trees built from axis-aligned partitions of the feature space. One such variant, called Mondrian forests, was proposed to handle the online setting and is the first class of random forests for which minimax rates were obtained in arbitrary dimension. However, the restriction to axis-aligned splits fails to capture dependencies between features, and random forests that use oblique splits have shown improved empirical performance for many tasks. In this work, we show that a large class of random forests with general split directions also achieve minimax optimal convergence rates in arbitrary dimension. This class includes STIT forests, a generalization of Mondrian forests to arbitrary split directions, as well as random forests derived from Poisson hyperplane tessellations. These are the first results showing that random forest variants with oblique splits can obtain minimax optimality in arbitrary dimension. Our proof technique relies on the novel application of the theory of stationary random tessellations in stochastic geometry to statistical learning theory.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Random Planted Forest: a directly interpretable tree ensemble](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14563v3)** | 2023-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel interpretable tree based algorithm for prediction in a regression setting. Our motivation is to estimate the unknown regression function from a functional decomposition perspective in which the functional components correspond to lower order interaction terms. The idea is to modify the random forest algorithm by keeping certain leaves after they are split instead of deleting them. This leads to non-binary trees which we refer to as planted trees. An extension to a forest leads to our random planted forest algorithm. Additionally, the maximum number of covariates which can interact within a leaf can be bounded. If we set this interaction bound to one, the resulting estimator is a sum of one-dimensional functions. In the other extreme case, if we do not set a limit, the resulting estimator and corresponding model place no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation study we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random planted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealized version of random planted forests in cases where the interaction bound is low. We show that if it is smaller than three, the idealized version achieves asymptotically optimal convergence rates up to a logarithmic factor.

| **[Joint Maximum Purity Forest with Application to Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09200v1)** | 2017-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel random-forest scheme, namely Joint Maximum Purity Forest (JMPF), for classification, clustering, and regression tasks. In the JMPF scheme, the original feature space is transformed into a compactly pre-clustered feature space, via a trained rotation matrix. The rotation matrix is obtained through an iterative quantization process, where the input data belonging to different classes are clustered to the respective vertices of the new feature space with maximum purity. In the new feature space, orthogonal hyperplanes, which are employed at the split-nodes of decision trees in random forests, can tackle the clustering problems effectively. We evaluated our proposed method on public benchmark datasets for regression and classification tasks, and experiments showed that JMPF remarkably outperforms other state-of-the-art random-forest-based approaches. Furthermore, we applied JMPF to image super-resolution, because the transformed, compact features are more discriminative to the clustering-regression scheme. Experiment results on several public benchmark datasets also showed that the JMPF-based image super-resolution scheme is consistently superior to recent state-of-the-art image super-resolution algorithms.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

The semi-supervised label propagation method takes into consideration local and global image appearance of images to be segmented and segments the images by propagating reliable segmentation results obtained by the supervised random forests method. Particularly, the random forests method is used to train a regression model based on image patches of atlas images for each voxel of the images to be segmented. The regression model is used to obtain reliable segmentation results to guide the label propagation for the segmentation.

| **[A Numerical Transform of Random Forest Regressors corrects Systematically-Biased Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07445v1)** | 2020-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, random forest models have become widely used as a robust method for high-dimensional data regression tasks. In part, the popularity of these models arises from the fact that they require little hyperparameter tuning and are not very susceptible to overfitting. Random forest regression models are comprised of an ensemble of decision trees that independently predict the value of a (continuous) dependent variable; predictions from each of the trees are ultimately averaged to yield an overall predicted value from the forest. Using a suite of representative real-world datasets, we find a systematic bias in predictions from random forest models. We find that this bias is recapitulated in simple synthetic datasets, regardless of whether or not they include irreducible error (noise) in the data, but that models employing boosting do not exhibit this bias. Here we demonstrate the basis for this problem, and we use the training data to define a numerical transformation that fully corrects it. Application of this transformation yields improved predictions in every one of the real-world and synthetic datasets evaluated in our study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alpha-Trimming: Locally Adaptive Tree Pruning for Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07151v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that adaptively controlling the size of individual regression trees in a random forest can improve predictive performance, contrary to the conventional wisdom that trees should be fully grown. A fast pruning algorithm, alpha-trimming, is proposed as an effective approach to pruning trees within a random forest, where more aggressive pruning is performed in regions with a low signal-to-noise ratio. The amount of overall pruning is controlled by adjusting the weight on an information criterion penalty as a tuning parameter, with the standard random forest being a special case of our alpha-trimmed random forest. A remarkable feature of alpha-trimming is that its tuning parameter can be adjusted without refitting the trees in the random forest once the trees have been fully grown once. In a benchmark suite of 46 example data sets, mean squared prediction error is often substantially lowered by using our pruning algorithm and is never substantially increased compared to a random forest with fully-grown trees at default parameter settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fitting Prediction Rule Ensembles with R Package pre](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07149v5)** | 2020-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction rule ensembles (PREs) are sparse collections of rules, offering highly interpretable regression and classification models. This paper presents the R package pre, which derives PREs through the methodology of Friedman and Popescu (2008). The implementation and functionality of package pre is described and illustrated through application on a dataset on the prediction of depression. Furthermore, accuracy and sparsity of PREs is compared with that of single trees, random forest and lasso regression in four benchmark datasets. Results indicate that pre derives ensembles with predictive accuracy comparable to that of random forests, while using a smaller number of variables for prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Forests for Big Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08327v2)** | 2017-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Big Data is one of the major challenges of statistical science and has numerous consequences from algorithmic and theoretical viewpoints. Big Data always involve massive data but they also often include online data and data heterogeneity. Recently some statistical methods have been adapted to process Big Data, like linear regression models, clustering methods and bootstrapping schemes. Based on decision trees combined with aggregation and bootstrap ideas, random forests were introduced by Breiman in 2001. They are a powerful nonparametric statistical method allowing to consider in a single and versatile framework regression problems, as well as two-class and multi-class classification problems. Focusing on classification problems, this paper proposes a selective review of available proposals that deal with scaling random forests to Big Data problems. These proposals rely on parallel environments or on online adaptations of random forests. We also describe how related quantities -- such as out-of-bag error and variable importance -- are addressed in these methods. Then, we formulate various remarks for random forests in the Big Data context. Finally, we experiment five variants on two massive datasets (15 and 120 millions of observations), a simulated one as well as real world data. One variant relies on subsampling while three others are related to parallel implementations of random forests and involve either various adaptations of bootstrap to Big Data or to "divide-and-conquer" approaches. The fifth variant relates on online learning of random forests. These numerical experiments lead to highlight the relative performance of the different variants, as well as some of their limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Random Forests to Reduce Bias; One-Step Boosted Forest and its Variance Estimate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08000v3)** | 2021-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose using the principle of boosting to reduce the bias of a random forest prediction in the regression setting. From the original random forest fit we extract the residuals and then fit another random forest to these residuals. We call the sum of these two random forests a \textit{one-step boosted forest}. We show with simulated and real data that the one-step boosted forest has a reduced bias compared to the original random forest. The paper also provides a variance estimate of the one-step boosted forest by an extension of the infinitesimal Jackknife estimator. Using this variance estimate we can construct prediction intervals for the boosted forest and we show that they have good coverage probabilities. Combining the bias reduction and the variance estimate we show that the one-step boosted forest has a significant reduction in predictive mean squared error and thus an improvement in predictive performance. When applied on datasets from the UCI database, one-step boosted forest performs better than random forest and gradient boosting machine algorithms. Theoretically we can also extend such a boosting process to more than one step and the same principles outlined in this paper can be used to find variance estimates for such predictors. Such boosting will reduce bias even further but it risks over-fitting and also increases the computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 7 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Central Limit Theorem for the permutation importance measure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13020v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Forests have become a widely used tool in machine learning since their introduction in 2001, known for their strong performance in classification and regression tasks. One key feature of Random Forests is the Random Forest Permutation Importance Measure (RFPIM), an internal, non-parametric measure of variable importance. While widely used, theoretical work on RFPIM is sparse, and most research has focused on empirical findings. However, recent progress has been made, such as establishing consistency of the RFPIM, although a mathematical analysis of its asymptotic distribution is still missing. In this paper, we provide a formal proof of a Central Limit Theorem for RFPIM using U-Statistics theory. Our approach deviates from the conventional Random Forest model by assuming a random number of trees and imposing conditions on the regression functions and error terms, which must be bounded and additive, respectively. Our result aims at improving the theoretical understanding of RFPIM rather than conducting comprehensive hypothesis testing. However, our contributions provide a solid foundation and demonstrate the potential for future work to extend to practical applications which we also highlight with a small simulation study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04342v4)** | 2017-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many scientific and engineering challenges -- ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations -- require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.

A variety of regression machine learning algorithms are known to be effective for health care cost predictions. The purpose of this experiment was to build an Azure Machine Learning Studio tool for rapid assessment of multiple types of regression models. The tool offers environment for comparing 14 types of regression models in a unified experiment: linear regression, Bayesian linear regression, decision forest regression, boosted decision tree regression, neural network regression, Poisson regression, Gaussian processes for regression, gradient boosted machine, nonlinear least squares regression, projection pursuit regression, random forest regression, robust regression, robust regression with mm-type estimators, support vector regression. The tool presents assessment results arranged by model accuracy in a single table using five performance metrics. Evaluation of regression machine learning models for performing hospital case cost prediction demonstrated advantage of robust regression model, boosted decision tree regression and decision forest regression. The operational tool has been published to the web and openly available for experiments and extensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03969v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a modification of Random Forests to estimate functions when unobserved confounding variables are present. The technique is tailored for high-dimensional settings with many observed covariates. We use spectral deconfounding techniques to minimize a deconfounded version of the least squares objective, resulting in the Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests (SDForests). We show how the omitted variable bias gets small given some assumptions. We compare the performance of SDForests to classical Random Forests in a simulation study and a semi-synthetic setting using single-cell gene expression data. Empirical results suggest that SDForests outperform classical Random Forests in estimating the direct regression function, even if the theoretical assumptions, requiring linear and dense confounding, are not perfectly met, and that SDForests have comparable performance in the non-confounded case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exogenous Randomness Empowering Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07554v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We offer theoretical and empirical insights into the impact of exogenous randomness on the effectiveness of random forests with tree-building rules independent of training data. We formally introduce the concept of exogenous randomness and identify two types of commonly existing randomness: Type I from feature subsampling, and Type II from tie-breaking in tree-building processes. We develop non-asymptotic expansions for the mean squared error (MSE) for both individual trees and forests and establish sufficient and necessary conditions for their consistency. In the special example of the linear regression model with independent features, our MSE expansions are more explicit, providing more understanding of the random forests' mechanisms. It also allows us to derive an upper bound on the MSE with explicit consistency rates for trees and forests. Guided by our theoretical findings, we conduct simulations to further explore how exogenous randomness enhances random forest performance. Our findings unveil that feature subsampling reduces both the bias and variance of random forests compared to individual trees, serving as an adaptive mechanism to balance bias and variance. Furthermore, our results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the presence of noise features can act as a "blessing" in enhancing the performance of random forests thanks to feature subsampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>103 p...</summary><p>103 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Neural Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07143v2)** | 2018-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an ensemble of randomized regression trees, it is possible to restructure them as a collection of multilayered neural networks with particular connection weights. Following this principle, we reformulate the random forest method of Breiman (2001) into a neural network setting, and in turn propose two new hybrid procedures that we call neural random forests. Both predictors exploit prior knowledge of regression trees for their architecture, have less parameters to tune than standard networks, and less restrictions on the geometry of the decision boundaries than trees. Consistency results are proved, and substantial numerical evidence is provided on both synthetic and real data sets to assess the excellent performance of our methods in a large variety of prediction problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quantum-Inspired Ensemble Method and Quantum-Inspired Forest Regressors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08117v1)** | 2020-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a Quantum-Inspired Subspace(QIS) Ensemble Method for generating feature ensembles based on feature selections. We assign each principal component a Fraction Transition Probability as its probability weight based on Principal Component Analysis and quantum interpretations. In order to generate the feature subset for each base regressor, we select a feature subset from principal components based on Fraction Transition Probabilities. The idea originating from quantum mechanics can encourage ensemble diversity and the accuracy simultaneously. We incorporate Quantum-Inspired Subspace Method into Random Forest and propose Quantum-Inspired Forest. We theoretically prove that the quantum interpretation corresponds to the first order approximation of ensemble regression. We also evaluate the empirical performance of Quantum-Inspired Forest and Random Forest in multiple hyperparameter settings. Quantum-Inspired Forest proves the significant robustness of the default hyperparameters on most data sets. The contribution of this work is two-fold, a novel ensemble regression algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and the theoretical connection between quantum interpretations and machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | 17 pages, ACML2017 |

The systems aim at dealing with the detection of overlapping audio events in continuous streams, where the detectors are based on random decision forests. The proposed forests are jointly trained for classification and regression simultaneously. Initially, the training is classification-oriented to encourage the trees to select discriminative features from overlapping mixtures to separate positive audio segments from the negative ones. The regression phase is then carried out to let the positive audio segments vote for the event onsets and offsets, and therefore model the temporal structure of audio events. One random decision forest is specifically trained for each event category of interest. Experimental results on the development data show that our systems significantly outperform the baseline on the Task2 evaluation while they are inferior to the baseline in the Task3 evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Task2...</summary><p>Task2 and Task3 technical report for the DCASE2016 challenge</p></details> |
| **[(f)RFCDE: Random Forests for Conditional Density Estimation and Functional Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07177v1)** | 2019-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests is a common non-parametric regression technique which performs well for mixed-type unordered data and irrelevant features, while being robust to monotonic variable transformations. Standard random forests, however, do not efficiently handle functional data and runs into a curse-of dimensionality when presented with high-resolution curves and surfaces. Furthermore, in settings with heteroskedasticity or multimodality, a regression point estimate with standard errors do not fully capture the uncertainty in our predictions. A more informative quantity is the conditional density p(y | x) which describes the full extent of the uncertainty in the response y given covariates x. In this paper we show how random forests can be efficiently leveraged for conditional density estimation, functional covariates, and multiple responses without increasing computational complexity. We provide open-source software for all procedures with R and Python versions that call a common C++ library.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1804.05753</p></details> |
| **[Improving Random Forests by Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06852v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases, also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact tree-splitting locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 4 pages appendix, 3 figures in appendix</p></details> |
| **[Random Spatial Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00150v2)** | 2020-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce random spatial forests, a method of bagging regression trees allowing for spatial correlation. Our main contribution is the development of a computationally efficient tree building algorithm which selects each split of the tree adjusting for spatial correlation. We evaluate two different approaches for estimation of random spatial forests, a pseudo-likelihood approach combining random forests with kriging and a non-parametric version for a general class of spatial smoothers. We show improved prediction accuracy of our method compared to existing two-step approaches combining random forests and kriging across a range of numerical simulations and demonstrate its performance on elemental carbon, organic carbon, silicon, and sulfur measurements across the continental United States from 2009-2010.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis of a Simple Model for Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02587v7)** | 2020-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random forests have become an important tool for improving accuracy in regression and classification problems since their inception by Leo Breiman in 2001. In this paper, we revisit a historically important random forest model originally proposed by Breiman in 2004 and later studied by Gérard Biau in 2012, where a feature is selected at random and the splits occurs at the midpoint of the node along the chosen feature. If the regression function is Lipschitz and depends only on a small subset of $ S $ out of $ d $ features, we show that, given access to $ n $ observations and properly tuned split probabilities, the mean-squared prediction error is $ O((n(\log n)^{(S-1)/2})^{-\frac{1}{S\log2+1}}) $. This positively answers an outstanding question of Biau about whether the rate of convergence for this random forest model could be improved. Furthermore, by a refined analysis of the approximation and estimation errors for linear models, we show that this rate cannot be improved in general. Finally, we generalize our analysis and improve extant prediction error bounds for another random forest model in which each tree is constructed from subsampled data and the splits are performed at the empirical median along a chosen feature.</p></details> |  |

We validate this approach by assessing its performance in the context of quantile regression; when applied to the outputs of linear, gradient boosted tree ensemble and random forest models. We find that it compares favourably to the standard approach for estimating quantile regression functions, especially for commonly selected tail probabilities, and is highly competitive with the quantile regression forest model, across a large collection of benchmark data sets.</p></details> |  |

These theorems were verified under a traditional random forest framework which uses classification and regression trees (CART) and bootstrap resampling. However, random forests using conditional inference (CI) trees and subsampling have been found to be not prone to variable selection bias. Here, we conduct simulation experiments using a novel approach to explore the applicability of the IJ to random forests using variations on the resampling method and base learner. Test data points were simulated and each trained using random forest on one hundred simulated training data sets using different combinations of resampling and base learners. Using CI trees instead of traditional CART trees as well as using subsampling instead of bootstrap sampling resulted in a much more accurate estimation of prediction variance when using the IJ. The random forest variations here have been incorporated into an open source software package for the R programming language.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel approach for constructing confidence regions around new predictions from any bagged regression algorithm with metric-space-valued responses. This includes the recent extensions of random forests for metric responses: Fréchet random forests (Capitaine et al., 2024), random forest weighted local constant Fréchet regression (Qiu et al., 2024), and metric random forests (Bulté and Sørensen, 2024). Our prediction regions leverage out-of-bag observations generated during a single forest training, employing the entire data set for both prediction and uncertainty quantification. We establish asymptotic guarantees of out-of-bag prediction balls for four coverage types under certain regularity conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the superior stability and smaller radius of out-of-bag balls compared to split-conformal methods through extensive numerical experiments where the response lies on the Euclidean space, sphere, hyperboloid, and space of positive definite matrices. A real data application illustrates the potential of the confidence regions for quantifying the uncertainty in the study of solar dynamics and the use of data-driven non-isotropic distances on the sphere.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables.

In this work, we provide the inTrees (interpretable trees) framework that extracts, measures, prunes and selects rules from a tree ensemble, and calculates frequent variable interactions. An rule-based learner, referred to as the simplified tree ensemble learner (STEL), can also be formed and used for future prediction. The inTrees framework can applied to both classification and regression problems, and is applicable to many types of tree ensembles, e.g., random forests, regularized random forests, and boosted trees.

| **[The Conditioning Bias in Binary Decision Trees and Random Forests and Its Elimination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10708v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision tree and random forest classification and regression are some of the most widely used in machine learning approaches. Binary decision tree implementations commonly use conditioning in the form 'feature $\leq$ (or $<$) threshold', with the threshold being the midpoint between two observed feature values. In this paper, we investigate the bias introduced by the choice of conditioning operator (an intrinsic property of implementations) in the presence of features with lattice characteristics. We propose techniques to eliminate this bias, requiring an additional prediction with decision trees and incurring no cost for random forests. Using 20 classification and 20 regression datasets, we demonstrate that the bias can lead to statistically significant differences in terms of AUC and $r^2$ scores. The proposed techniques successfully mitigate the bias, compared to the worst-case scenario, statistically significant improvements of up to 0.1-0.2 percentage points of AUC and $r^2$ scores were achieved and the improvement of 1.5 percentage points of $r^2$ score was measured in the most sensitive case of random forest regression.

India produces a humungous quantity of Mulberry leaves which in turn produces the raw silk. Since the climatic conditions in India is favourable, Mulberry is grown throughout the year. Majority of the farmers hardly pay attention to the nature of soil and abiotic factors due to which leaves become malnutritious and thus when they are consumed by the silkworm, desired quality end-product, raw silk, will not be produced. It is beneficial for the farmers to know the amount of yield that their land can produce so that they can plan in advance. In this paper, different Machine Learning techniques are used in predicting the yield of the Mulberry crops based on the soil parameters. Three advanced machine-learning models are selected and compared, namely, Multiple linear regression, Ridge regression and Random Forest Regression (RF). The experimental results show that Random Forest Regression outperforms other algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are based on univariate statistical tests, but when multiple traits are analyzed together they suffer from a multiple-testing problem and from not taking into account correlations among the traits. An alternative approach to multi-trait GWAS is to reverse the functional relation between genotypes and traits, by fitting a multivariate regression model to predict genotypes from multiple traits simultaneously. However, current reverse genotype prediction approaches are mostly based on linear models. Here, we evaluated random forest regression (RFR) as a method to predict SNPs from imaging QTs and identify biologically relevant associations. We learned machine learning models to predict 518,484 SNPs using 56 brain imaging QTs. We observed that genotype regression error is a better indicator of permutation p-value significance than genotype classification accuracy. SNPs within the known Alzheimer disease (AD) risk gene APOE had lowest RMSE for lasso and random forest, but not ridge regression. Moreover, random forests identified additional SNPs that were not prioritized by the linear models but are known to be associated with brain-related disorders. Feature selection identified well-known brain regions associated with AD,like the hippocampus and amygdala, as important predictors of the most significant SNPs. In summary, our results indicate that non-linear methods like random forests may offer additional insights into phenotype-genotype associations compared to traditional linear multi-variate GWAS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Regression Forests for Probabilistic Precipitation Forecasting in Complex Terrain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02921v3)** | 2020-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To obtain a probabilistic model for a dependent variable based on some set of explanatory variables, a distributional approach is often adopted where the parameters of the distribution are linked to regressors. In many classical models this only captures the location of the distribution but over the last decade there has been increasing interest in distributional regression approaches modeling all parameters including location, scale, and shape. Notably, so-called non-homogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR) models both mean and variance of a Gaussian response and is particularly popular in weather forecasting. Moreover, generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) provide a framework where each distribution parameter is modeled separately capturing smooth linear or nonlinear effects. However, when variable selection is required and/or there are non-smooth dependencies or interactions (especially unknown or of high-order), it is challenging to establish a good GAMLSS. A natural alternative in these situations would be the application of regression trees or random forests but, so far, no general distributional framework is available for these. Therefore, a framework for distributional regression trees and forests is proposed that blends regression trees and random forests with classical distributions from the GAMLSS framework as well as their censored or truncated counterparts. To illustrate these novel approaches in practice, they are employed to obtain probabilistic precipitation forecasts at numerous sites in a mountainous region based on a large number of numerical weather prediction quantities. It is shown that the novel distributional regression forests automatically select variables and interactions, performing on par or often even better than GAMLSS specified either through prior meteorological knowledge or a computationally more demanding boosting approach.</p></details> |  |
